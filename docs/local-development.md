# Local development

This is an unsupported development pathway. You may proceed at your own risk, but the team is not able to support questions about native/local development.

This file may be removed at a future point as an unsupported development pathway.

### Install the tools

`brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv`

If your tools are previously installed, you may need to

`brew update && brew upgrade pyenv`

to have all of the most recent versions of Python available. This could be slow if you haven't updated in a while. Get a cup of â˜•.

(Your setup process on Windows/Linux will vary. Currently, we assume local development in a Linux-like environment.)

### Update your environment

You will likely need to [update your shell](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33321312/cannot-switch-python-with-pyenv).

```
eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
```

should end up somewhere in `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or whatever flavor of shell you're using.

### Set link flags

You *might* need to set link flags. Otherwise, when you `make install`, there could be failures in the building of `psycog2`. YMMV.

```
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/opt/expat/lib" && export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/opt/expat/include" && export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/opt/expat/include"
```

### Create a virtual environment

You may need to install the Python version being used by the team. The following take place in the `backend` directory of the checked out repository.

```
FAC_PYTHON_VERSION=`cat .python-version`
pyenv install $FAC_PYTHON_VERSION
```

You may run into a `pyenv` mismatch between the version in `.python-version` and possible versions `pyenv` supports, for example, `.python-version` might contain `3.10` but `pyenv` only allows `3.10.0` or other minor versions of `3.10`. One approach to fixing this is to create a symlink in `~/.pyenv/versions` pointing a `3.10` symlink at whatever installed version you prefer. A command to do this might look like `ln -s ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.1 ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10`.

Then, set up the virtualenv.

`pyenv virtualenv $FAC_PYTHON_VERSION FAC`

### Activate your new virtual environment

`pyenv activate FAC`

Depending on how you feel about seeing the virtualenv in your prompt:

```
pyenv-virtualenv: prompt changing will be removed from future release. configure `export PYENV_VIRTUALENV_DISABLE_PROMPT=1' to simulate the behavior.
```

### Install python dependencies

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pip-tools
```

### Django environment variables

We use environment variables to configure much of how Django operates, at a minimum you'll need to configure the uri of your local database.

Set a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with the uri of your local database
    *  `postgresql://[userspec@][hostspec][/dbname]`
