# 3. Make `gsa-tts/fac` repository public

Introduced: 20220420

## Status

Discussion

## Context

We prefer to work in the open, and our repositories should reflect that.

We made our initial (`FAC`) repository private because we did not know what, exactly, would be in it.

`FAC` contains product-oriented code and discussions. We believe this can, and should, be public. 

## Decision

Switch `GSA-TTS/FAC` from private to public, and leave `GSA-TTS/FAC-Frontend` public. 

## Consequences

We may need, for one reason or another, make one or both repositories private at some point in the future. At that point, we will discuss and write another PDR documenting our decision.
