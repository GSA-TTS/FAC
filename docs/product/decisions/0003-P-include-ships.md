# 3. Put the ships in the repository

Introduced: 20220408

## Status

For Discussion

## Context

Our weekly ships are currently emails posted to partners, and copy-pasted into Slack. 

Let's post weekly ships into the repository, and then point everyone to those.

## Decision

Make our weekly ships completely public, and make them part of the repository.

## Consequences

We currently assume the readership for the ships are only federal partners within the GSA and partner agencies. This will make them fully public artifacts.

1. People will know what music we listen to.
2. We may need to filter what we say (e.g. if we mention people by name?) in a more public space.

This PDR suggests that the weekly ships are important artifacts that are part of the life of the project, and should be part of the project's history.
