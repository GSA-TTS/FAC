# 2. Work in the open

Introduced: 20220408

## Status

For Discussion

## Context

Our repository was established as private in large part because we were waiting for the public announcement of the GSA as a the new Federal Audit Clearinghouse per 2CFR200. That has now happened, and we are engaging with the community.

## Decision

Flip our repository from *private* to *public*.

## Consequences

There are many, but those consequences (positive and negative) are common to *all* open projects.

Positive consequences include:

1. A place where we could, if desired, engage the community directly.
2. A place where our partners can see what we are doing directly.
3. A place where our colleagues within the GSA can see our work.
4. Model how to work on such services in the federal government openly.

#4 has been done before, of course. But, perhaps not in the grants space?
