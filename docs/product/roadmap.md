This is a high-level, *agile* overview of the FAC product roadmap. We recognize that there are other aspects of the program that are needed for a successful launch For more detail, see our [story map](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://app.mural.co/t/gsa6/m/gsa6/1647625636085/7825fa5ead63ebb1b65eefab5ea20d24a8ab7c59?wid%3D0-1647626493256%26sender%3Dua4d37dfba3f1e69e09078790&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1654713307298233&usg=AOvVaw2VRKptBGcaZgHol3V6vXpw). The team revisits and adjusts the roadmap regularly. 

## Product Vision

The Federal Audit Clearinghouse (FAC) is and must continue to be a trusted, transparent and quickly actionable source of grants information to speed reporting, audit resolution, and risk mitigation. The goal of the TTS FAC is to seamlessly transition auditee/auditor/agency users, make audit data more transparent, and deliver a system that is maintainable for TTS by October of 2023. 

Our long-term vision:

* **Seamlessly transition auditee/auditor/agency users:**
  * Core aspects of auditee, auditor and agency workflows are carried over
  * Improvements to design and accessibility
  * Clear transition communication on what changes are happening and when
* **Make audit data more accessible and transparent:**
  * Single audit data is easily accessible to the public to increase transparency and accountability
  * Single audit data is easily accessible to government agencies so that they can make informed decisions and prevent fraud
  * Single audit data is flexible enough to connect to other data sets and systems
* **Deliver a system that is maintainable for TTS:**
  * Application is written in a modern and maintainable technology stack TTS can support
  * Remove manual processing step to remove administrative burden
  * Uncouple unmaintainable integrations (i.e. ATAS) by transitioning agency users the new API
