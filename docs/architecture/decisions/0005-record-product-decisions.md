# 5. Record product decisions

Introduced: 2022-03-30

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to record the product decisions made on this project.

## Decision
To record significant decisions in this project, We will use a variant of Architecture Decision Records as [described by Michael Nygard in this article](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

The context/decision/consequences framework should work for us; we will alter this as needed (and document it when we do) for product-level decisions.

## Consequences
See Michael Nygard's article, linked above.

## Notes
This was originally product decision record 0001; renamed/renumbered as part of merging ADRs and PDRs.
