# Validations

An essential function of this application is to validate inbound SF-SAC and SingleAudit data. This document serves as a repository of:

* Each specific validation, including the fields/attributes examined, the logic applied, and a plain-language summary
* Where and how each validation is defined
* Where and how each validation is tested
* Notes on how these validations can be modified
