Similar to the architecture and product decision record process, we will track policy decisions in this repository to ensure we have a lasting record of what is decided. 

The following policy questions are currently considered out of scope for the transition effort, but will be considered after the transition is complete: 

1. Some grant programs apply subpart F of 2 CFR 200 to for-profit/commercial organizations. The FAC is not specifically capturing for-profits as an organization type. We will decide if this be updated in the new system. 

2. Consider the submission of foreign single audit reports along with the for-profit and commercial audit reports. 

3. What is the process for an agency communicate the need to change FAC to include for-profit/commercial organizations?
