## Onboarding

As a new engineer assigned to the FAC, it's a great idea to familiarize yourself with Python, Django, and Cloud.govâ€”all tools used in this project.

 - [ ] If you need to catch up on the latest in Python development, check out the [Python developer's guide](https://devguide.python.org/).
 - [ ] Work through the [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/tutorial01/) and writing your first Django app.
 - [ ] If you're not already, get [setup with Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/setup/)
 - [ ] Practice deploying a [python application](https://github.com/cloud-gov/cf-hello-worlds/tree/main/python-flask) to Cloud.gov using the Cloud.gov command line interface (CLI): https://cloud.gov/docs/getting-started/your-first-deploy/.
 - [ ] Survey existing TTS projects which use Django+Cloud.gov like: [Tock](https://github.com/18F/tock) and the [DOJ CRT Portal](https://github.com/usdoj-crt/crt-portal).

Once you're up to speed, check out [Local Development](./development.md#local-development) to get setup with a local development environment and start contributing!
