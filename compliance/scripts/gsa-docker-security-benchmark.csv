In this case, the user name or ID refers to the user that was found in the container base image. If there is no specific user created in the container base image, then make use of the `useradd` command to add a specific user before the `USER` instruction in the Dockerfile.

For example, add the below lines in the Dockerfile to create a user in the container:
```
RUN useradd -d /home/username -m -s /bin/bash username
USER username 
```
Note: If there are users in the image that are not needed, you should consider deleting them. After deleting those users, commit the image and then generate new instances of the containers.

Alternatively, if it is not possible to set the `USER` directive in the Dockerfile, a script running as part of the `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT` sections of the Dockerfile should be used to ensure that the container process switches to a non-root user.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You should execute the command below to remove unneeded capabilities:
```
docker run --cap-drop={""Capability 1"",""Capability 2""}

5.7,Level 1,Yes,Daemon,,Ensure privileged ports are not mapped within containers,"You should not map container ports to privileged host ports when starting a container. You should also, ensure that there is no such container to host privileged port mapping declarations in the Dockerfile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.8,Level 1,No,Daemon,,Ensure that only needed ports are open on the container,"You should ensure that the Dockerfile for each container image only exposes needed ports. You can also completely ignore the list of ports defined in the Dockerfile by **NOT** using `-P` (UPPERCASE) or the `--publish-all` flag when starting the container. Instead, use the `-p` (lowercase) or `--publish` flag to explicitly define the ports that you need for a particular container instance.

For example:
```
docker run --interactive --tty --publish 5000 --publish 5001 --publish 5002 centos /bin/bash
```",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.9,Level 1,Yes,Daemon,,Ensure that the host's network namespace is not shared,You should not pass the `--net=host` option when starting any container.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.10,Level 1,Yes,Daemon,,Ensure that the memory usage for containers is limited,"You should run the container with only as much memory as it requires by using the `--memory` argument. 

For example, you could run a container using the command below:
```
docker run --interactive --tty --memory 256m centos /bin/bash
```
In the example above, the container is started with a memory limit of 256 MB.

Note that the output of the command below returns values in scientific notation if memory limits are in place.
```
docker inspect --format='{{.Config.Memory}}' 7c5a2d4c7fe0
```

For example, if the memory limit is set to `256 MB` for a container instance, the output of the command above would be `2.68435456e+08` and NOT 256m. You should convert this value using a scientific calculator.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.11,Level 1,Yes,Daemon,,Ensure that CPU priority is set appropriately on containers,"You should manage the CPU runtime between your containers dependent on their priority within your organization. To do so start the container using the `--cpu-shares` argument. 

For example, you could run a container as below:
```
docker run --interactive --tty --cpu-shares 512 centos /bin/bash
```

In the example above, the container is started with CPU shares of 50% of what other containers use. So if the other container has CPU shares of 80%, this container will have CPU shares of 40%.

Every new container will have `1024` shares of CPU by default. However, this value is shown as `0` if you run the command mentioned in the audit section.

Alternatively:

1. Navigate to the `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/system.slice/` directory.
2. Check your container instance ID using `docker ps`.
3. Inside the above directory (in step 1), you could have a directory called, for example: `docker-.scope`. For example, `docker-4acae729e8659c6be696ee35b2237cc1fe4edd2672e9186434c5116e1a6fbed6.scope`. Navigate to this directory.
4. You will find a file named `cpu.shares`. Execute `cat cpu.shares`. This will always give you the CPU share value based on the system. Even if there are no CPU shares configured using the `-c` or `--cpu-shares` argument in the `docker run` command, this file will have a value of `1024`.

If you set one container’s CPU shares to `512` it will receive half of the CPU time compared to the other containers. So if you take `1024` as 100% you can then derive the number that you should set for respective CPU shares. For example, use `512` if you want to set it to 50% and `256` if you want to set it 25%.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.12,Level 1,Yes,Daemon,,Ensure that the container's root filesystem is mounted as read only,"You should add a `--read-only` flag at a container's runtime to enforce the container's root filesystem being mounted as read only. 

```
docker run  --read-only  
```

Enabling the `--read-only` option at a container's runtime should be used by administrators to force a container's executable processes to only write container data to explicit storage locations during its lifetime.

Examples of explicit storage locations during a container's runtime include, but are not limited to: 

1. Using the `--tmpfs` option to mount a temporary file system for non-persistent data writes. 

```
docker run --interactive --tty --read-only --tmpfs ""/run"" --tmpfs ""/tmp"" centos /bin/bash
``` 

2. Enabling Docker `rw` mounts at a container's runtime to persist container data directly on the Docker host filesystem. 

```
docker run --interactive --tty --read-only -v /opt/app/data:/run/app/data:rw centos /bin/bash
``` 

3. Utilizing the Docker shared-storage volume plugin for Docker data volume to persist container data. 

```
docker volume create -d convoy --opt o=size=20GB my-named-volume
```

```
docker run --interactive --tty --read-only -v my-named-volume:/run/app/data centos /bin/bash
```

3. Transmitting container data outside of the Docker controlled area during the container's runtime for container data in order to ensure that it is persistent. Examples include hosted databases, network file shares and APIs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5.13,Level 1,Yes,Daemon,,Ensure that incoming container traffic is bound to a specific host interface,"You should bind the container port to a specific host interface on the desired host port.

In the example above, the container port `80` is bound to the host port on `49153` and would accept incoming connection only from the `10.2.3.4` external interface.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
