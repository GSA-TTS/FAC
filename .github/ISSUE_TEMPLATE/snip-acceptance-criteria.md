# Acceptance Criteria

[comment]: # "ACs should be clearly demoable/verifiable whenever possible."
[comment]: # "Given: the initial context at the beginning of the scenario"
[comment]: # "when: the event that triggers the scenario"
[comment]: # "then: the expected outcome(s)"
[comment]: # "Repeat scenarios as needed, or repeat behaviors and lists within a scenario as needed."

[comment]: # "The scenario should be a short, plain language description."
[comment]: # "Feeling repetative? Apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle!"
