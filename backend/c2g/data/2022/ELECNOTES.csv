The basic financial statements present the general fund and special revenue fund on a GAAP basis. Budgetary comparison statements or schedules (RSI) are presented for the general fund and the special revenue fund to demonstrate finance-related legal compliance in which certain revenue is permitted by law or grant agreement to be recognized in the fiscal year, whereas for GAAP reporting, revenue is not recognized until the subsequent year or when expenditures have been made.                                                                                                                                                         The general fund is presented in the accompanying schedules on the modified accrual basis of accounting with the exception of the revenue recognition of the last two state aid payments in the current year, which is mandated pursuant to N.J.S.A. 18A:22-44.2. For GAAP purposes, those payments are not recognized until the subsequent year due to the state deferral and recording of the last state aid payments in the subsequent year. The special revenue fund is presented in the accompanying schedules on the grant accounting budgetary basis, which recognizes encumbrances as expenditures and also recognizes the related revenues, whereas the GAAP basis does not. The special revenue fund also recognizes the state aid payments in the current budget year, consistent with N.J.S.A. 18A:22-44.2.

The Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) federal award expenditures relate primarily to costs incurred and fees earned under cost plus fixed fee type contracts with agencies of the DOD. Costs incurred and fees earned under these contracts are determined in accordance with the terms of the contracts and the contract cost principles and procedures set forth in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and, where applicable, agency acquisition regulations that implement or supplement the FAR. Under terms of the contracts and provisions of the FAR, certain expenditures are not allowable or are limited as to reimbursement. Expenditures include indirect costs, relating primarily to general and administrative activities and technical supervision and services at the APL, which are allocated to the direct cost objectives (including federal awards) which benefit from the activities using bases and methods considered appropriate for the various types of costs involved. Indirect costs are allocated to federal awards and billed to sponsoring agencies during each cost accounting period based on agreed upon provisional rates; variances between actual costs incurred and costs allocated and billed using the provisional rates are adjusted periodically.

With this measurement focus, only current assets, current liabilities and fund balances are included on the balance sheet.  Operating statements of these funds present increases and decreases in net current assets. The modified accrual basis of accounting is used for the governmental fund types.  This basis of accounting recognizes revenues in the accounting period in which they become susceptible to accrual (i.e., both measurable and available) and expenditures in the accounting period in which the fund liability is incurred, if measurable, except for unmatured interest on long-term debt, which is recognized when due, and certain compensated absences and claims and judgments, which are recognized when the obligations are expected to be liquidated with expendable available financial resources.
