Federal Award Identification Number and Year - P425E201974 - Year ended June 30, 2022
Pass through Entity - Not applicable
Finding Type - Significant deficiency
Repeat Finding - No
Criteria - The U.S. Department of Education, through a notice issued on May 13, 2021, requires that quarterly reports related to HEERF are publicly posted on the University's website no later than 10 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Further, the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund III FAQ dated May 11, 2021 requires reporting activity separately each quarter.
Condition - The quarterly report for the student portion of HEERF was not posted on the University's website within the time frame and format allowed in one instance.
Questioned Costs - None
Identification of How Questioned Costs Were Computed - Not applicable
Context - The student portion report for the quarter ended September 30, 2021 was not posted on the University's website within the required time frame. 
Cause and Effect - Confirmation of the upload of the quarterly report for the student HEERF grant under the American Rescue Plan (ARP) was not monitored sufficiently to ensure timely posting to the University's website.
Recommendation - We recommend the University implement additional monitoring controls to ensure that required reports for grants that are new, or for which the University does not have historical experience (such as HEERF), are issued according to the prescribed guidance within the allowed time frame. 
Views of Responsible Officials and Corrective Action Plan - The University agrees with the finding and recommendation. The University spent and accounted for $75.6 million in HEERF grants appropriately and followed all applicable guidelines. The University also adhered to the various reporting guidelines that changed multiple times during the grant period, with the exception of this one untimely report posting to the Oakland University website. This was caused by personnel turnover occurring at that time within multiple departments that were part of the process. This situation was unique and has been corrected.

Finding 2022-001 Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly, AL 14.157
Statement of Condition
In connection with our lease file review, we noted the following deficiencies:
2 out of 13 tenants tested did not have documentation in their lease file that their income
was verified.
Criteria
Tenant lease files are required to be maintained and tenant eligibility determined in accordance
with HUD Handbook 4350.3, Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing
Programs.
Effect
The procedures for determining tenant security deposits and eligibility and maintaining tenant
lease files were not consistently applied in accordance with HUD Handbook 4350.3, Occupancy
Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs. This could result in units being
rented to ineligible tenants or errors in the rent subsidies paid by HUD.
Cause
Management's policies with respect to the determination of tenant security deposits and
eligibility and the maintenance of tenant lease files in accordance with HUD Handbook 4350.3,
Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily Housing Programs were not consistently
followed.
Recommendation
Management should establish procedures and monitor compliance with those procedures to
ensure that tenant security deposits are correctly recorded, tenant eligibility is correctly
determined and that tenant lease files are properly maintained in accordance with the
requirements of HUD Handbook 4350.3, Occupancy Requirements of Subsidized Multifamily
Housing Programs.
Auditor Noncompliance Code: R - Section 8 program administration (REAC); E - Eligibility
(UG)
Finding Resolution Status: In process. The late completion of our audits for fiscal years 2020
and 2021 has contributed to our not getting our budgets for the new fiscal years submitted and
approved timely. Therefore, Management did not have access to the Enterprise Income
Verification (EIV) system [the system used to access Social Security information and Health and
Human Service information] for a period of time so that they could verify income. This issue is
anticipated again in fiscal year 2023 because of the late submission of the fiscal year 2022
budget which required the fiscal year 2021 actual data. Steps are being taken to have the fiscal
year 2022 audit completed in a reasonable timeframe, and we do not anticipate the same
problem going forward.
Reporting Views of Responsible Officials
Management agrees with the finding and is taking steps to address the issue that caused it.",N,971740,1,D6VLAANVC5E7,N

Pass through Entity - None
Finding Type - Significant deficiency and material noncompliance with laws and regulations
Repeat Finding - No
Criteria - CARES Act 18004(e) and the CRRSAA 314(e) require an institution receiving funds under HEERF I and HEERF II to submit a report to the secretary at such time in such a manner as the secretary may require. ARP Act 2003 specifies that the same terms and conditions of CRRSAA 314 apply to HEERF III funds. While the acts do not explicitly identify procedures by which institutions must report on their uses of HEERF grant funds, pursuant to these requirements, the Department of Education required quarterly public reporting of student portion and institutional portion awards and an annual report. Additionally, the quarterly reports should be conspicuously posted on the institution’s website as separate documents by quarter and should not be cumulative.
Condition - The University did not properly post the HEERF Quarterly Reporting Form by quarter to its website. Additionally, for the HEERF Quarterly Reporting Forms that were posted to its website, the student and institutional expenditures were reported cumulative.  
Questioned Costs - N/A
Identification of How Questioned Costs Were Computed - N/A
Context - The University only posted the the December 31, 2021 HEERF Quarterly Reporting Forms to its website for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and the expenditures included in these reports were cumulative.                                              
Cause and Effect - There were inadequate controls implemented to ensure that the required information was properly made available on the University's website and that reports were prepared accurately.
Recommendation - The University should implement additional controls to ensure reporting requirements for federal grants are complied with in all instances.

Assistance Listing:  21.027 – Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSLFRF)
Federal Grantor:  Department of the Treasury
Compliance Requirement:  Reporting
Condition:  The Project and Expenditure Reports were not filed.
Criteria:  The Subrecipient Agreement between the City of Elk Grove and the District. Section 10 states Subrecipient shall comply with any applicable reporting obligations established by the Department of the Treasury as they relate to this Agreement.  Department of Treasury Compliance and Reporting Guidance for CSLFRF, Part 2, Section B outlines reporting requirements.  Reports on projects funded, expenditures, and contracts and subawards equal to or greater than $50,000, and other information are required annually for recipients serving populations under 250,000 and receiving less than $10 million in CSLFRF funding.
Cause:  The District believed that as a subrecipient of funds the funding provider would prepare and file the required reporting.
Effect:  Treasury may impose additional conditions on the receipt of a subsequent tranche of future award funds, if any, or take other available remedies as set forth in 2 C.F.R. § 200.339.
Recommendation:  We recommend the District file the initial Project and Expenditures Report for the period covering March 3, 2021 to March 31,2022 as soon as possible.  Subsequent annual reports should be filed by the April 30, 2023 deadline.

Assistance Listing:  21.027 – Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (CSLFRF)
Federal Grantor:  Department of the Treasury 
Compliance Requirement:  Procurement and Suspension and Debarment
Condition:  The District used a sole source authorization for the procurement of a Type-1 Fire Engine but a competitive bid process should have been used to comply with Uniform Guidance.
Criteria:  Non-state entities under the program, must follow the procurement standards in 2 CFR sections 200.318 through 200.327, including ensuring that the procurement method used for the contracts are appropriate based on the dollar amount and conditions specified in 2 CFR section 200.320.  Specifically, procurements in excess of $250,000 be conducted using a competitive procurement method such as bids or proposals. Further, the District’s Purchasing Policy Sec 2112.13 requires staff obtain competitive bids for the purchase of supplies, equipment or service that are $15,000 or greater.
Interagency or cooperative purchasing agreements may be leveraged, but they must comply with the Unform Standards, and 2 CFR section 200.320(c) states noncompetitive procurement can only be awarded if one or more of the following circumstances apply:
1)	The acquisition of property or services, the aggregate dollar amount of which does not exceed the micro-purchase threshold (see paragraph (a)(1) of this section);
2)	The item is available only from a single source;
3)	The public exigency or emergency for the requirement will not permit a delay resulting from publicizing a competitive solicitation;
4)	The Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity expressly authorizes a noncompetitive procurement in response to a written request from the non-Federal entity; or
5)	After solicitation of a number of sources, competition is determined inadequate.
Cause:  The District’s Purchasing Policy allows for a sole source vendor with the approval of the Chief Administrative Officer.  In addition, the Policy allows the District to purchase through a purchasing alliance, such as a cooperative agreement.  The sole source vendor has a cooperative purchasing agreement through National Purchasing Partners (NPP) cooperative, contract number PS20240.  The District’s justification for sole source vendor was uniformity of vendors across safety equipment which fosters ease of operator training and emergency scene efficiency.  The approval indicated standardization also supports ongoing maintenance of the fleet.  
While permitted by internal policy, this justification does not appear to meet any of the noncompetitive procurement exceptions allowed by the Uniform Standards outlined above.  The District was also unable to provide documentation that the vendor purchasing agreement through NPP complies with the Uniform Standards for procurement.
Effect:  Treasury may impose additional conditions on the receipt of a subsequent tranche of future award funds, if any, or take other available remedies as set forth in 2 C.F.R. § 200.339.
Recommendation:  We recommend the District work with FEMA to obtain written approval for the sole source procurement, which is one of the exceptions to noncompetitive procurements.

Compliance Requirement:  Other compliance requirements.
Condition:  The schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards (SEFA) was not complete, and expenditures reported on the SEFA were revised during the single audit.
Criteria:  2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F (Uniform Guidance) Section 200.502 states, “The auditee should prepare a Schedule of Expenditures of Federal Awards for the period covered by the auditee’s financial statements.”  Internal controls over the SEFA should be in place ensure accrual basis expenses incurred under the federal program are properly reported as expenses on the SEFA and are properly reported as revenue in the financial statements prior to the start of the single audit.
Cause:  SEFA was not fully reconciled and finalized until after the single audit began.
Effect:  The expenses included on the SEFA were revised during the single audit, which could have resulted in the auditor not selecting the correct major program or expenses for testing and could have resulted in the single audit not satisfying the requirements of the Uniform Guidance.

Housing Choice Voucher 
Material Weakness/Noncompliance
Questioned Costs:  $26,887.48

Criteria:  HUD Notice PIH-2020-08 provided the guidance for the allowable uses of the HUD CARES Act funding for the Housing Choice Voucher program.  HUD Notice PIH-2020-24 extended the period of availability to December 31, 2021 which meant expenses for after December 31, 2021 were not allowable items to be charged to  this funding.  

Condition:  The Authority utilized its HCV HUD CARES Act funding to pay for its annual software and support that covered the period of July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022.  As a result, one half of this expense was for the period after December 31, 2021 and is not an allowable expense for the HUD CARES Act grant.
 
Cause:  The Authority did not consider the impacts of the software contract extending past the December 31, 2021 deadline.  

Effect or Potential Effect:  $26,887.48 of HUD CARES Act expenses are unallowable as they were for expenses past December 31, 2021.  An adjustment was recorded during the audit to reflect the $26,8887.48 as a payable back to HUD. 

Recommendation:  The Authority should review this situation with HUD and determine its options.  The HCV program had numerous other operating expenses it could have allocated to the grant that would have been allowable.  The Authority should request from HUD if it could allocate other expenses from prior to December 31, 2021 to the CARES Act program or determine if the funds must be repaid to HUD.

View of the Responsible Officials of the Auditee:  The auditee’s management agrees with the finding.

COVID-19, 84.425U-0137146
Known Questioned Cost Amount:	$0

Background
The objectives of the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) program are to prevent, prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal year 2022, the District expended a total of $22,519,443 of its ESF awards. This included $3,648,641 in the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER II) subprogram (84.425D), $18,850,563 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER/ESSER III) subprogram (84.425U), and $20,239 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief – Homeless Children and Youth (ARP HCY I & II) subprogram (84.425W).
Federal regulations require recipients to establish and maintain internal controls that ensure compliance with program requirements. These controls include understanding grant requirements and monitoring the effectiveness of established controls.
Under federal wage rate requirements, also known as the Davis-Bacon Act, contractors and subcontractors that work on projects financed with more than $2,000 of federal money must pay laborers and mechanics wage rates that the 
U.S. Department of Labor considers being similar to what local workers have been paid for similar projects.
For construction contracts subject to these wage rate requirements, the District must include a provision that the contractor and subcontractor comply with those requirements and the Department of Labor’s regulations. This includes a requirement for the contractor and its subcontractor to submit to the District weekly, for each week in which any contract work is performed, certified payroll reports. These reports must include a copy of the payroll and a signed statement of compliance.
The District may use a contracted project manager to collect certified payroll reports from contractors and subcontractors, but ultimately, it is the District’s responsibility to comply with these requirements and maintain documentation demonstrating compliance.
Description of Condition
During the 2021-22 school year, the District spent $2,685,727 from its ESSER II award to pay two contractors and their subcontractors for installing and upgrading the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems at four school buildings and the District office. These projects were part of the District’s school facility capital improvement efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and enable school operations by facilitating greater air flow and filtration. During the audit period, the District awarded and entered into a contract with one of the contractors, and contracted with two project managers to supervise the projects, which included collecting weekly certified payroll reports from the contractors and subcontractors.
Our audit found the District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements. Specifically, the District did not:
•	Include the required prevailing wage rate clauses in the contract established with one contractor
•	Collect, or ensure project managers collected, weekly certified payroll reports from the contractors and their subcontractors to confirm they paid laborers proper prevailing wages
We consider these deficiencies in internal controls to be a material weakness, which led to material noncompliance.
The issue was not reported as a finding in the prior audit.
Cause of Condition
District staff said they used a purchasing cooperative to procure the general contractor, and they relied on the contract between the purchasing cooperative and the general contractor, which included the required prevailing wage language. However, staff said they did not know the District was required to include this language in its own contract with the contractor.
Additionally, the District relied on the project managers to verify the contractors and subcontractors submitted weekly certified payroll reports to the Washington State Labor and Industries (L&I) website. Although District staff said they checked that weekly certified payroll reports were uploaded to the L&I system before the District paid the contractors, this process was not documented. Further, District staff and project managers did not know the District needed to obtain all certified payroll reports each week.
Effect of Condition 
Without adequate internal controls that ensure it includes the prevailing wage rate clauses in its contracts and collects all weekly certified payroll reports, the District cannot demonstrate it complied with federal wage rate requirements. The District could also be liable for paying any additional wages if the contractors and subcontractors did not pay prevailing wage rates to laborers working on the contracts.
Recommendation
We recommend the District develop internal controls to ensure compliance with federal wage rate requirements. This should include inserting prevailing wage rate clauses into contracts, as well as implementing effective monitoring processes to collect and review all weekly certified payroll reports timely from contractors and subcontractors.
District’s Response
The District agrees with the State Auditor’s Office that we did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements as noted. The District used the same process as noted in this Finding in the prior audit which did not have any exceptions noted by the State Auditors Office. Moving forward the District will ensure federal prevailing wage rate clauses are in contracts entered into using federal funds and that weekly certified payroll reports are collected from contractors and subcontractors.
Auditor’s Remarks
We appreciate the District’s commitment to resolve this finding and thank the District for its cooperation and assistance during the audit. We will review the status of the District’s corrective action during our next audit.
Applicable Laws and Regulations
Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), section 516, Audit findings, establishes reporting requirements for audit findings.
Title 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Guidance, section 303, Internal controls, describes the requirements for auditees to maintain internal controls over federal programs and comply with federal program requirements.
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants defines significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in its Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, section 935, Compliance Audits, paragraph 11.
Title 29 CFR, Section 3.3 – Weekly statement with respect to payment of wages, and Section 3.4 – Submission of weekly statements and the preservation and inspection of weekly payroll records, establishes requirements for contractor or subcontractor submission of weekly certified payroll reports.
Title 29 CFR, Section 5.5 – Contract provisions and related matters establishes the requirements for the contracting officer to insert in full any contract in excess of $2,000 which is entered into for the actual construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of a public building or public work, or building or work financed in whole or in part with federal funds the clauses listed, which includes but is not limited to the minimum wages to be paid and payrolls and basic records to be maintained (submission of weekly certified payrolls)

Finding 2022-001 – Internal Control over Financial Reporting Material Weakness

Criteria: The Authority must properly record and report all fixed assets and net fixed assets.

Condition: During testing, inquiry, and observation, we noted the Authority changed fee accountants during the year. During the conversion the authority added material fixed assets to the financial statements for assets that had been removed from service and disposed of in the prior year. The authority also inappropriately deleted a material fixed asset that was still in service. Additionally unsubstantiated prior period adjustments were made to fixed assets. The authority did not properly capitalize material purchases of capital equipment during the year. 

Cause and Effect: The Authority improperly recorded material fixed assets which resulted in the material overstatement of fixed assets and overstatement of maintenance expenses during the year. 

Recommendation: The Authority needs to work with the fee accountant to ensure the proper recording of fixed assets and expenses.

View of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Action:  We will work with our fee accountant to ensure our that fixed assets and expenses are appropriately recorded.

Finding 2022-002
Federal program: 20.513 Total Enhanced Mobility of Seniors and Individuals With Disabilities
Federal agency: U. S. Department of Transportation Award year: 2021-2022
Criteria: When a non-Federal entity enters into a covered transaction with an entity at a lower tier, the non-Federal entity must verify that the entity, as defined in 2 CFR section 180.995 and agency adopting regulations, is not suspended or debarred or otherwise excluded from participating in the transaction. This verification may be accomplished by (1) checking the System for Award Management (SAM) Exclusions maintained by the General Services Administration (GSA) and available at sam.gov/content/home, (2) collecting a certification from the entity, or (3) adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that entity (2 CFR section 180.300).
Condition: The City’s internal controls did not properly identify and/or document its covered transactions of $25,000 or more, that require verification.
Cause: The City did not retain evidence that it complied with the suspension and debarment requirements.

Known Questioned Cost Amount: $0
Background
The objectives of the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) program are to prevent, 
prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal year 2022, the 
District spent $1,917,896 of its ESF awards. This included $1,113,450 in the 
Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER II) subprogram 
(84.425D), $802,272 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary 
School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER/ESSER III) subprogram (84.425U), and 
$2,173 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency 
Relief – Homeless Children and Youth (ARP ESSER - HCY I & II) subprogram 
(84.425W)Federal regulations require award recipients to establish and maintain internal 
controls that ensure compliance with program requirements. These controls include 
understanding grant requirements and monitoring the effectiveness of established 
controls.
Under federal wage rate requirements, also known as the Davis-Bacon Act, 
contractors and subcontractors that work on projects financed with more than 
$2,000 of federal money must pay laborers and mechanics wage rates that the 
U.S. Department of Labor considers being similar to what local workers have been 
paid for similar projects.
For construction contracts subject to these wage rate requirements, the District must 
include a provision that the contractor and subcontractor comply with those 
requirements and the Department of Labor’s regulations. This includes a 
requirement for the contractor and its subcontractor to submit to the District weekly, 
for each week in which any contract work is performed, certified payroll reports. 
These reports must include a copy of the payroll and a signed statement of 
compliance.
Description of Condition
During the 2021-22 school year, the District spent $449,988 from its ESSER III 
award to pay one contractor for work it performed on a project to add a portable 
building to the District’s campus.
Our audit found the District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring 
compliance with federal wage rate requirements. Specifically, the District did not 
include the required prevailing wage rate clauses in the contract with the prime 
contractor. We consider this deficiency in internal controls to be a material 
weakness, which led to material noncompliance.
This issue was reported as a finding in the prior audit as finding 2021-001.
Cause of Condition
District staff included the state prevailing wage language in the construction 
contract. However, staff did not know the District also needed to include the federal 
prevailing wage requirements.Effect of Condition and Questioned Costs
Without adequate internal controls to ensure it includes the required prevailing 
wage clauses in public works contracts, the District cannot demonstrate it complied 
with federal wage rate requirements. This increases the risk that contractors would 
not know the project is subject to federal prevailing wage requirements and pay the 
higher of state or federal wage. The District could also be liable for paying any 
additional wages if the contractor and subcontractors did not pay prevailing wage 
rates to laborers working on the contracts.
Recommendation
We recommend the District develop internal controls to ensure compliance with 
federal wage rate requirements. This should include inserting the prevailing wage 
rate clauses into construction contracts.
District’s Response
The District administration will obtain and include required Davis-Bacon Act 
contract language to facilitate adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance 
with the federal wage rate requirements in future federally funded projects.
Auditor’s Remarks
We appreciate the District’s commitment to resolve this finding and thank the 
District for its cooperation and assistance during the audit. We will review the 
corrective action taken during our next regular audit.

Noncompliance and Significant Deficiency in Internal Controls over SEMAP submission.
Criteria: The Uniform Financial Reporting Standards (UFRS), at 24 CFR § 985.101, require Authorities to submit SEMAP certification form within 60 calendar days after the end of its fiscal year. 
Condition and Context: During the audit for the year ended June 30, 2022, it was discovered that the Authority had not submitted the SEMAP certification within 60 days of the end of the fiscal year.
Effect or Potential Effect: As a result of this noncompliance, the PHA could receive an overall performance rating of “troubled” which means the PHA will be subject to the requirements of CFR § 985.107 “Required actions for PHA with troubled performance rating.”. This may include: on-site reviews by HUD with a written reports to follow, a corrective action plan to address any issues that HUD identified, monitoring of the corrective action plan, prohibition of use of administrative fees, and upgrading the poor performance rating via HUDs determination that a change in the rating is warranted. 
Cause: The cause of this error is managements lack of control over monitoring the deadline associated with submission of the SEMAP certification. 
Recommendation: We recommend that management adds this and any other pertinent deadlines to a calendar for better tracking throughout the year.
Views of Responsible Official(s): Management agrees with the finding and have outlined a plan of action in the corrective action plan section of this report",N,968829,1,NKQ8J5E7NCQ1,N

Criteria or Specific Requirement: Special Tests and Provisions – Enrollment Reporting:  Institutions are required to report enrollment information under the Pell grant and the Direct and Federal Family Education Loan (“FFEL”) loan programs via the National Student Loan Data System (“NSLDS”) (OMB No.1845-0035), although FFEL loans are no longer made or a part of the Student Financial Assistance Cluster, a student may have a FFEL loan from previous years that would require enrollment reporting for that student (Pell, 34 CFR 690.83(b)(2); FFEL, 34 CFR 682.610; Direct Loan, 34 CFR 685.309). The administration of the Title IV programs depends heavily on the accuracy and timeliness of the enrollment information reported by institutions. Institutions must review, update, and verify student enrollment statuses, program information, and effective dates that appear on the Enrollment Reporting Roster file or on the Enrollment Maintenance page of the NSLDS Professional Access (“NSLDSFAP”) website which the financial aid administrator can access for the auditor. The data on the institution’s Enrollment Reporting Roster, or Enrollment Maintenance page, is what NSLDS has as the most recently certified enrollment information. There are two categories of enrollment information; “Campus Level” and “Program Level,” both of which need to be reported accurately and have separate record types. The NSLDS Enrollment Reporting Guide provides the requirements and guidance for reporting enrollment details using the NSLDS Enrollment Reporting Process. According to the Guide, any errors identified and returned by NSLDS in an Error/Acknowledgement file should be corrected and resubmitted within 10 days.
	
Condition: Campus Level: The University did not report certain students’ changes in enrollment status to NSLDS within the required timeframe.

Program Level: The University did not accurately report certain students’ significant data elements to NSLDS.

Certain error/acknowledgement file errors were not corrected within the required timeframe.
	
Cause: Administrative oversight.
 
Effect or Possible Effect: The University was not in compliance with enrollment reporting requirements. Failure to promptly report accurate and timely changes in enrollment status may adversely impact the repayment status for student loan borrowers.
	
Questioned Costs: None.
	
Context: For 2 of 40 campus level records tested, the University did not timely report the students’ withdrawn status to NSLDS.

For 1 of 25 program level records tested, the University failed to report the student’s withdrawn status to NSLDS.

For 2 of 25 program level records tested, the University failed to report the students’ second major program of study.

Several instances of repeating error records were identified throughout the fiscal year.
	
Recommendation:	We recommend that the University enhance its procedures to ensure accurate and timely enrollment reporting. 
	
Views of Responsible Officials:	The University has modified reporting practices to SSCR in order to meet Federal Regulations 34 CFR 690.83(b)(2), 34 CFR 682.610 and 34 CFR 685.309. The Office of Academic Records will report student enrollment to SSCR on the 15th of every month (or the following business day if the 15th falls on a weekend, holiday or scheduled university closure). This plan will allow for reporting from SSCR to NSLDS to meet the 60 day timeline for student status change. The University has also strengthened report criteria to ensure that all current program and major detail are provided to SSCR.

Context: For 5 out of 25 students tested for NSLDS reporting, it was noted that these students were not reported within 60 days as required for all schools participating in Title IV aid. Crowe had management perform an independent analysis in order to quantify the total number of students with enrollment reporting issues due to the 5 identified as part of our testing. Through further testing procedures performed and analysis performed by management it was noted that a total of 38 students were not reported timely to the NSLDS.
Effect or Potential Effect: The administration of the Title IV programs depends heavily on the accuracy and timeliness of the enrollment information reported by institutions. Inaccurate reporting or not timely reporting student status changes to NSLDS will have an impact on the timeliness of the student entering repayment.
Recommendation: We recommend that the University enhance its review and monitoring of the enrollment reporting to NSLDS to ascertain accuracy and timeliness of the submission. We recommend management perform a review of the students after being reported to NSLDS to ensure that were accurately and timely reporting as well as implement a monitoring control internally to ensure all students who changed stated are properly identified and reported to the NSLDS.
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions: The University agrees that accurate enrollment reporting is required and has taken steps to change the process. See corrective action plan.",N,962068,1,J3KPEDNN74R6,N

Condition: The Health Center must prepare and apply a sliding fee discount schedule (SFDS) so that the amounts owed for health center services by eligible participants are adjusted based on the patient’s ability to pay. 
Questioned costs: n/a
Context: The auditor selected a sample of 60 encounters. After the auditor tested selection #49, enough errors had been identified that the auditor stopped testing because the sample results could not support a low assessed level of control risk. The errors were a result of the misapplication of the sliding fee discount. The sliding fee discounts are based on the slide level code. In these instances, the sliding fee discount that was applied was not in accordance with the SFDS. 
Effect or Potential Effect: Either the Health Center or the patients may be paying more than required under the contract.
Cause: The Health Center applied its SFDS inconsistently to the patients selected for testing. 
Recommendation: The Health Center should adopt an internal control procedure that allows them to consistently apply its SFDS to all eligible patients.

Federal Grantor Name:	U.S. Department of Education
Federal Award/Contract Number:	N/A
Pass-through Entity Name:	Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction

COVID-19, 84.425U-137151
COVID-19, 84.425U-712234
Known Questioned Cost Amount:	$0

Background
The objectives of the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) program are to prevent, prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal year 2022, the District spent a total of $1,560,045 of its ESF awards. This included $608,734 in the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER II) subprogram (84.425D), and $951,311 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER/ESSER III) subprogram (84.425U).
Federal regulations require recipients to establish and maintain internal controls that ensure compliance with program requirements. These controls include understanding grant requirements and monitoring the effectiveness of established controls.
Under federal wage rate requirements, also known as the Davis-Bacon Act, contractors and subcontractors that work on projects financed with more than $2,000 of federal money must pay laborers and mechanics wage rates that the 
U.S. Department of Labor considers being similar to what local workers have been paid for similar projects.
For construction contracts subject to these wage rate requirements, the District must include a provision that the contractor and subcontractor comply with those requirements and the Department of Labor’s regulations. This includes a requirement for the contractor and its subcontractor to submit to the District weekly, for each week in which any contract work is performed, certified payroll reports. These reports must include a copy of the payroll and a signed statement of compliance.
The District may use a contracted project manager to collect certified payroll reports from contractors and subcontractors, but ultimately, it is the District’s responsibility to comply with these requirements and maintain documentation demonstrating compliance.
Description of Condition
During the 2021-22 school year, the District spent $673,437 from its ESSER II and ESSER III awards to pay a contractor and its subcontractors for installing and upgrading the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems at its middle and high school buildings. This project was part of the District’s school facility capital improvement efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and enable school operations by facilitating greater air flow and filtration. During the audit period, the District contracted with one project manager to assist in developing the contract between the District and the contractor, as well as collecting weekly certified payroll reports from the contractor and subcontractors.
Our audit found the District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements. Specifically, the District did not:
•	Include, or ensure the project manager included, the required prevailing wage rate clauses in the contract established with its contractor
•	Collect, or ensure the project manager collected, weekly certified payroll reports from the contractor and its subcontractors to confirm they paid laborers proper prevailing wages
We consider these deficiencies in internal controls to be a material weakness, which led to material noncompliance.
The issue was not reported as a finding in the prior audit.
Cause of Condition
The District relied on the project manager to include the federal prevailing wage rate clause in the contract with the contractor, and District management and staff did not know this language was missing when they reviewed and approved the contract.
Additionally, District management did not know about the federal requirement to collect all certified payroll reports from the contractor and its subcontractors each week to confirm they paid laborers proper prevailing wages.
Effect of Condition 
Without adequate internal controls that ensure it includes the prevailing wage rate clauses in its contract and collects all weekly certified payroll reports, the District cannot demonstrate it complied with federal wage rate requirements. The District could also be liable for paying any additional wages if the contractor and subcontractors did not pay prevailing wage rates to laborers working on the contract.
Recommendation
We recommend the District develop internal controls that ensure compliance with federal wage rate requirements. This should include inserting the prevailing wage rate clauses into contracts, as well as implementing effective monitoring processes to collect and review all weekly certified payroll reports timely from contractors and subcontractors.
District’s Response
All parties contracting services will receive training on prevailing wage compliance. The business manager will review and ensure the requirements are being met.
Auditor’s Remarks
We appreciate the District’s commitment to resolve this finding and thank the District for its cooperation and assistance during the audit. We will review the status of the District’s corrective action during our next audit.

Ohio Rev. Code §§ 3313.843 and 3313.845 allow traditional schools to contract with Educational Service Centers (ESCs) to provide services as outlined in the agreement between the two parties. Ohio Rev. Code §3313.843(C) requires these agreements to be filed with the Ohio Department of Education by the first day of July of the school year for which the agreement is in effect.
 
Effective on December 26, 2014, 2 CFR § 200.320 outlined the methods of procurement to be followed by state subrecipient non-Federal entities when expending certain types of Federal funds, including those received through Grant Agreements. However, 2 CFR § 200.110(a), created a “grace period” for compliance with 2 CFR §200.320, by permitting non-Federal entities to comply with previously issued Office of Management and Budget procurement guidance for all fiscal years beginning prior to December 26, 2017.
 
In January 2020, the Ohio Department of Education (ODE) published a form that allows schools to request ODE authorize a noncompetitive proposal for their ESC Services.  This form is available on ODE’s website.  

During the fiscal year, the School District contracted with Allen County Educational Service Center (ESC) to provide purchased services. These services included expenditures of $46,283, which were paid for out of the Special Education Cluster Grants and subject to the Federal procurement laws. The School District did not complete the form that allows schools to request ODE authorize a noncompetitive proposal for their ESC Services that is available on the ODE website.   Under 2 CFR §200.320 the School District should have competitively bid the services needed or obtained price quotes from qualified sources as further defined in the School District’s procurement policy.  

The School District should develop a control(s) and/or procedure(s) to verify that established procurement procedures are followed when entering into contracts using Federal monies. The ODE form that allows schools to request ODE authorize a noncompetitive proposal for their ESC Services should be utilized for any ESC contract in the future.  Failure to follow proper procurement procedures could result in contracts awarded to entities which do not meet all the needs of the School District or have a cost significantly higher than their competitors, as well as a loss in future federal funding and possible questioned costs in future audits.

Condition found.
The Organization accounted for its activities based on the services provided, which are educational 
services and food services. During our financial and compliance audit procedures for the fiscal year 
ended June 30, 2022, we noted the following conditions related to the accounting procedures and 
financial reporting practices of the Organization:
a. Accounting and interim financial reports are not executed on a current (month-to-month) basis. 
Accounting journals, general ledger and interim financial reports, such as Balance Sheet, 
Statement of Activities and Bank Reconciliations, monthly analysis of certain accounts are 
executed after the end of the related accounting year.
Criteria
2 CFR 200.302 (b) (2), (4), (5) and (7) establish that the financial management system of each nonFederal entity must provide for the following:
i. Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or
program in accordance with the reporting requirements set forth in §§ 200.327 Financial reporting 
and 200.328 Monitoring and reporting program performance.
Cause
Contracted outsource for the general accounting of the institution have been unable to prepare the 
monthly accounting and the related interim financial reports on a current basis.
Effect
Weaknesses in the internal controls of the institution, requiring extra efforts from the administration to 
compensate for the lack of current accountability with additional alternative measures and procedures.
Noncompliance with the above-mentioned requirements could lead to administrative actions by the

Included in prior years Findings No. 2017-001,2018-001, 2019-001,2020-001 and 2021-001.
Recommendations
The Organization should enforce its policies and procedures in order to accurately maintain its financial 
information, and on a timely basis, assuring that they reflect its assets and liabilities, and to maintain an 
appropriate control over its revenues and the amounts expended, which will allow a proper management 
and monitoring of operations. These policies and procedures should be enforced to consider the 
following:
• Establish monthly and year end closing procedures.
• Prepare monthly or quarterly financial reports for management evaluation and analysis.
Views of Responsible Officials
The Organization agrees with the finding. Executed actions have substantially improved their year-end 
closing procedures. They contracted a new accounting firm to improve their accounting and the interim 
financial reporting. Also, during the year ended June 30, 2022, an internal accountant was hired, who 
among other things, is coordinating and supervising the record keeping and compilation of interim and 
year end closing and reporting process. Subsequent to June 30, 2022, the institution decided to perform
the accounting and reporting function internally, commencing on July 1, 2022.
