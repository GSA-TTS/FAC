Condition: The quarterly report for the student portion of HEERF was not posted on the University's website within the timeframe allowed in one instance.
Planned Corrective Action: The University agrees with the finding and recommendation. The University spent and accounted for $75.6 million in HEERF grants appropriately and followed all applicable guidelines. The University also adhered to the various reporting guidelines that changed multiple times during the grant period, with the exception of this one untimely report posting to the Oakland University website. This was caused by personnel turnover that occurred at that time in multiple departments which were part of the process. This situation was unique and has been corrected.

1. Finding 2022-001
a. Comments on the Finding and Each Recommendation
The auditee agrees with the finding. The late completion of the audits for fiscal
years 2020 and 2021 has contributed to management not getting the budgets for
the new fiscal years submitted and approved by HUD timely. As a result,
management did not have access to the EIV system for a period of time so that
they could verify income. This issue is anticipated again in fiscal year 2023
because of the late submission of the fiscal year 2022 budget which required the
fiscal year 2021 actual data.
b. Action(s) Taken or Planned on the Finding
The late completion of our audits for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 has contributed
to our not getting our budgets for the new fiscal years submitted and approved
timely. Therefore, Management did not have access to the Enterprise Income
Verification (EIV) system [the system used to access Social Security information
and Health and Human Service information] for a period of time so that they
could verify income. This issue is anticipated again in fiscal year 2023 because of
the late submission of the fiscal year 2022 budget which required the fiscal year
2021 actual data. Steps are being taken to have the fiscal year 2022 audit
completed in a reasonable timeframe, and we do not anticipate the same
problem going forward.
