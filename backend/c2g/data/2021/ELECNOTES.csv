Federal and state awards generally are accounted for in a Special Revenue Fund, a component of the governmental fund types.  A Special Revenue Fund is used to account for resources restricted to, or committed for, specific purposes by a grantor.  The accounting and financial reporting treatment applied to a fund is determined by its measurement focus.  The governmental fund types are accounted for using a current financial resources measurement focus.  With this measurement focus, only current assets and current liabilities generally are included on the balance sheet.  Operating statements of these funds represent increases (i.e., revenues and other financing sources) and decreases (i.e., expenditures and other financing uses) in net current assets.  The modified accrual basis of accounting is used for these funds.  This basis of accounting recognizes revenues in the accounting period in which they become susceptible to accrual, i.e., both measurable and available, and expenditures in the accounting period in which the liability is incurred, if measurable, except for certain compensated absences and claims and judgments, which are recognized when the obligations are expected to be liquidated with expendable available financial resources.  The District has elected to not use the ten percent de minimis indirect cost rate allowed under Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance).  Federal grant funds are considered to be earned to the extent of expenditures made under the provisions of the grant, and, accordingly, when such funds are received, they are recorded as unearned revenues until earned.
