Significant Deficiency
Criteria: According to 2 CFR section 200.305(b)(5), when non-federal entities are funded under the reimbursement method, the entity should pay for costs for which reimbursement was requested prior to the date of the reimbursement request.

Condition: During our audit, we noted the monthly claims for reimbursement are not compared to reports from the point of sale (“POS”) system by an individual other than the preparer of the claims report prior to submission.

Cause: A second review of the monthly claims for reimbursement was not performed by an individual other than the preparer prior to submission. The same individual prepares and submits the monthly claims for reimbursement. A second review of monthly claims for reimbursement prior to submission will provide additional assurance that claims are based on actual meals served.

Effect: Claims for reimbursement may not be accurately reported; as a result, payments received may not be based on actual meals served.

Recommendation: We recommend that the District have an individual other than the preparer of the claims report review the reports from the POS system prior to submission to verify that the number of meals claimed is based on actual meals served.

District’s Response: The District’s response is included in their corrective plan.

34918,252670,2021,2021-002,"Finding 2021-002: Subrecipient Monitoring

Federal Programs: All Programs

Criteria: The Foundation, as a pass-through entity, is required under 2 CFR § 200.332(d) to ""Evaluate each subrecipient's risk of noncompliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward for purposes of determining the appropriate subrecipient monitoring"". 

Condition: During our current year compliance testing under Uniform Guidance requirements, while we noted that subrecipient was approved by the grantor, we noted certain monitoring practices were not in compliance. 

Cause: The Foundation did not adhere to its subrecipient monitoring policy in that it failed to perform the prescribed monitoring procedures throughout the fiscal year.

Effect or Potential Effect: Without adequate subrecipient monitoring, the Foundation becomes at risk that noncompliance could take place with the Federal funding they receive and pass-through to subrecipients, thereby making costs or activities unallowable with the potential for funding to be required to be repaid to the Federal Government.

Questioned Costs: Undetermined.

Context: The Foundation failed to perform and/or properly document its due diligence with respect to these requirements. The issue is considered systemic in nature.

Recommendation: In order to ensure this condition is mitigated in the future, we believe the Foundation should implement certain enhancements with respect to monitoring of its subgrantee that value in ensuring it has exercised timely due diligence with respect to its grant making process. Following are our recommendations (of activities/documents that should be performed/ maintained by the accounting team, in the Finance office):

An evaluation of the financial (and programmatic) risk associated with the intended recipient for the purpose of determining the expected level of oversight during the grant period.
Documentation of the grantee’s internal controls, accounting system, sophistication of financial personnel.
A regularly documented review process with respect to periodic financial reports received from grantees, with a reconciliation of cumulative cash sent against cash reports (and any bank statements) furnished by the grantee. 
Payment requests made by grantees should be accompanied by supporting documentation such as profit and loss statement for the grant period, and receipts.
Receipt of the grantee’s annual audit reports, if available (to ensure there are no weaknesses or deficiencies in internal control during the grant period).",N,924559,1,,
34919,252670,2021,2021-001,"Finding 2021-001: Accounting System

Federal Programs: All Programs

Criteria: As stated in 2 CFR Subpart D, §200.302 “Financial Management”, the non-Federal entity's (i.e. the Foundation) financial management systems, including records documenting compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award, must be sufficient to permit the preparation of reports required by general and program-specific terms and conditions; and the tracing of funds to a level of expenditures  adequate to establish that such funds have been used according to the Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal award.

Condition: Our audit procedures disclosed that the Foundation currently does not have a double-entry accounting system designed to support the needs for financial reporting, as required when receiving direct Federal funding. We further noted that the Foundation used the cash basis of accounting during the year under audit. Consequently, several entries were posted to the unaudited financial statements to be in compliance with U.S. GAAP.

Cause: The Foundation did not have the adequate accounting system in place to ensure proper and accurate financial reporting.

Effect or Potential Effect: Without the adequate accounting system, there exists the potential for undetected errors or misappropriation of funds, as well as internal financial statements that are incomplete, inaccurate and unreliable.

Context: The Foundation did not have the adequate accounting system in place. The issue is considered systemic in nature.

Recommendation: While a formal accounting software package is expected to be implemented, we recommend this occur as soon as possible. The Accounting system of the Foundation must provide the following:

Identification, in its accounts, of all Federal awards received and expended and the Federal programs under which they were received. 
Accurate, current, and complete disclosure of the financial results of each Federal award or program in accordance with the reporting requirements. 
Records that identify adequately the source and application of funds for Federally-funded activities. 
Effective control over, and accountability for, all funds, property, and other assets. 
Comparison of expenditures with budget amounts for each Federal award. 

We also recommend that the implementation of the new accounting software be formalized in writing and incorporated into the accounting policies and procedures manual.",N,924559,1,,

Statement of Condition: Records provided to comply with the five percent non-Federal WIPA match requirement were not based on actual costs and expected volunteer hours planned for the match requirement did not occur. 

Criteria: Per the Title 1 Chapter, Ticket to Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, Part C, Subpart Section 1149, awardees of Social Security Administration cooperative agreements are required to contribute a non-Federal match of at least 5 percent towards the total cost of each project.  The non-Federal share may be cash or in-kind (property or services) contributions.  

2 CFR 200.306 provides that cost sharing or matching funds must be allowable under subpart E which requires costs to be determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and be adequately documented.

Cause:  Due to the continuing pandemic, the Organization cancelled planned in-person events and meetings due to COVID-19 protocols.  As a result, associated volunteer time that normally would be available to meet the five percent match did not occur.  In addition, due to turnover in personnel, the calculation of internal expenditures utilized for the match were not calculated based on the actual costs up to $16,100 based on the total contract amount.   

Effect of the Condition: Management did not provide adequate documentation to ensure that the required five percent match was met.  Non-compliance with regulations can result in questioned costs.  

Recommendation: We recommend that management recalculate match based on actual costs and alert the appropriate agency if after recalculation match has not been met.  In addition, the match should be monitored to ensure that if planned events do not occur, other sources of allowable match expenditures are identified. 

Views of Responsible Officials:  Management agrees with the finding.

Federal Agency: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

Pass-through Agency: Not applicable

Award Number / Year: Not applicable / 2020

Criteria: Non-federal entities in receipt of federal funds must comply with the requirements of 2 CFR 200.303(a), which require an entity to establish and maintain effective internal control over the federal award to ensure compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal award.  Provider Relief Funds (PRF) payments must be used for allowable expenses and lost revenue described in the PRF terms and conditions and specified in guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

Additionally, all recipients of PRF payments must comply with the reporting requirements described in the PRF terms and conditions and specified in directions issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 

Condition/Context: The Health System did not complete the PRF portal reporting in accordance with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidance.  During our testing of the Period 1 and Period 2 consolidated PRF reports for the Health System, we observed the following exceptions: 

•	The Health System did not submit the required stand-alone reporting for the Period 2 targeted distribution for St. Barnabas Nursing Home, Inc. related to infection control payments.  The infection control payments were instead reported on the consolidated Health System Period 2 portal submission as Other Assistance. 
•	The Health System had calculated and maintained supporting documentation for lost revenues for both Periods 1 and 2.  However, lost revenue was never reported on the Period 1 and Period 2 portal submissions as intended.
•	The expenses reported in the portal and applied to the PRF payments for Periods 1 and 2 could not be reconciled to the Health System’s records (i.e., general ledger detail). However, the combined amount of lost revenue and eligible expenses per the Health System’s records was greater than PRF payments received. 

The underlying populations and support for the Health System’s expenses and lost revenue records were subjected to testing.  The issues observed above related to inability to reconcile what was provided as part of the audit to what was submitted as part of the required reporting at the time it was completed. 

This was not a statistically valid sample. 

Effect: The amounts reported to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) were not in accordance with established U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reporting guidance.
 
Questioned Costs: Not determinable.

Cause: The person responsible for PRF portal submission reporting for Periods 1 and 2 was not properly trained and there was no formal review process in place.  

Recommendation: We recommend management perform a detailed review of the portal reporting instructions and implement a formal review process to be performed prior to submission for any future submissions that may be required.  We also recommend that management work with the federal agency to correct the Period 1 and Period 2 reporting errors through a revision to past reporting or updates via future reporting, as applicable and deemed appropriate by the federal agency official. 

Views of Responsible Officials: The person responsible for reporting within the PRF portal was not properly trained and there was no formal review process in place.  A better understanding of how to complete the PRF portal reporting has been obtained through review of the User Guide and a pre-submission review process will be implemented for future submissions.  The Health System will contact the appropriate party at the Health Resources and Services Administration to determine if an amended or corrected report can be filed.

CFDA Number and Title:	93.323 – COVID 19 – Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases
Federal Grantor Name:	U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
Federal Award/Contract Number:	N/A
Pass-through Entity Name:	Washington State Department of Health
Pass-through Award/Contract Number:	CLH18237

Questioned Cost Amount:	$0

Description of Condition
The objective of the Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity for Infectious Diseases program is to protect the public’s health and safety by enhancing the capacity of public health agencies to effectively detect, respond, prevent and control known and emerging (or reemerging) infectious diseases. During fiscal year 2021, the District spent $3,339,085 in federal funding to operate a COVID-19 testing site.
Federal regulations require recipients to establish and maintain internal controls that ensure compliance with program requirements. These controls include understanding program requirements and monitoring the effectiveness of established controls. 
Federal regulations also prohibit recipients from contracting with parties suspended or debarred from doing business with the federal government. Whenever the District contracts for goods or services expected to equal or exceed $25,000, paid all or in part with federal funds, it must verify the contractor is not suspended, debarred or otherwise excluded. The District can verify a contractor’s status by checking for exclusion records in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov), collecting a written certification from the contractor, or adding a clause or condition into the contract. The District must perform this verification before entering into the contract, and keep documentation demonstrating compliance with this federal requirement. Federal regulations also prohibit recipients from contracting with parties suspended or debarred from doing business with the federal government. Whenever the District contracts for goods or services expected to equal or exceed $25,000, paid all or in part with federal funds, it must verify the contractor is not suspended, debarred or otherwise excluded. The District can verify a contractor’s status by checking for exclusion records in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov)), collecting a written certification from the contractor, or adding a clause or condition into the contract. The District must perform this verification before entering into the contract, and keep documentation demonstrating compliance with this federal requirement. 
Our audit found the District did not have an adequate process in place to verify that all parties receiving $25,000 or more in federal funds were not suspended or debarred. The District did not obtain a written certification, include a clause in the contract, or check SAM.gov to verify that two of the five contractors used were not suspended or debarred. The District did not obtain a written certification, include a clause in the contract, or check SAM.gov to verify that two of the five contractors used were not suspended or debarred.
We consider this deficiency in internal controls to be a material weakness that led to material noncompliance.
These issues were not reported as a finding in the prior audit.
Cause of Condition
The District indicated they queried SAM.gov to determine if the contractors were suspended or debarred however they did not retain the print outs documenting the results.  
Effect of Condition
The District did not obtain written certifications, insert a clause into the contracts, or check SAM.gov to verify two of five contractors were not suspended or debarred. 
Without this verification, the District increases its risk of providing federal funds to contractors that are excluded from participating in federal programs. Any payments the District made to an ineligible party would be unallowable, and the federal grantor could potentially recover them. 
We were able to verify the contractors were not suspended or debarred. Therefore, we are not questioning costs for these payments
Recommendation
We recommend the District develop processes and procedures to ensure staff verify contractors’ suspension and debarment status before contracting with them. 
District’s Response
The District agrees with the recommendation from the State Auditor’s Office to strengthen internal controls to ensure compliance with federal suspension and debarment requirements.  The District will formalize a process to check all new contractor’s exclusion records in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) and to retain copies of those searches in the vendor’s file including those searches where the vendor is not found in the system.

Auditor’s Remarks
We appreciate the District’s commitment to resolve this finding and thank the District for its cooperation and assistance during the audit. We will review the corrective action taken during our next regular audit.

The NSLDS Enrollment Reporting Guide further states that the information that is reported to the Department of Education is accurate in addition to timely.

Condition:
During our testing of students that were disbursed financial aid during the 2020-21 school year, there were four instances in which the students’ status change date per University records did not match the dates reported to NSLDS.

Cause:
The withdrawal date was incorrectly reported to NSLDS.

Effect:

2021-001 WRITTEN POLICIES NEED ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS

Criteria
Written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct are required by 2 CFR 200, Subparts D and E (2 CFR sections 200.300 and 200.400, respectively). The regulations require that the Water System follow their written policies and procedures, including procurement and purchasing, and that they must comply with federal regulations for such transactions and contracts.

The following sections of the Uniform Guidance require nonfederal entities that receive federal awards, including subrecipients of states, to establish written policies, procedures, or standards of conduct:
•	Financial management (200.302)
•	Payment (200.305)
•	General procurement standards (200.318)
•	Competition (200.319)
•	Methods of procurement to be followed (200.320)
•	Cost price analysis on items for procurement actions in excess of simplified acquisition threshold (200.323)
•	Suspension and debarment (180.220)

Condition
In 2021, the Water System’s written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct, specifically applicable for this major federal award program, did not include all procedures covering procurement and purchasing. Although the Water System appears to have acted in a manner that ensured compliance with other requirements, the written policies do not appear to include sufficient details to clearly address all of the elements required by federal regulations. 

Cause
The regulations are complex.

Effect
While it appears that the Water System has complied with other compliance requirements, the lack of sufficient written policies and procedures could lead to other instances of noncompliance.

Questioned Costs
I did not identify any questioned costs.

Perspective
The condition is a systemic problem. The project has a budget of $1,150,000. This is funded under the loan program, where the Water System is a subrecipient of funds flowing through Louisiana Department of Health. 

First Year
2021

Recommendation
I recommend that the Water System compare written policies and procedures to federal regulations and include further details where necessary to ensure compliance with the regulations requiring written policies and to prevent noncompliance with other regulations.

Views of Responsible Officials
The Atlanta Water System, Inc. had written policies. These policies were being followed and we felt we were complying with state and federal requirements for procurement and purchasing.  Upon being made aware policies were required to be written in greater detail related to federal regulations, we amended our written policies and procedures to include such language as required.

Status
Corrected by adding requirements to written policies and procedures.

expenses necessary for the operation and maintenance of the project.
Condition
S-2700-010
""Equity skimming deprives the project of needed funds for repairs, maintenance, and improvements, which
contributes to the financial and physical deterioration of the project and the standard of living conditions for the
families who depend on the federal government to provide housing."" The audit uncovered a variety of costs
charged to the project by the property management company that are either specifically excluded expenses
per federal regulations cited above or are simply not necessary or actual expenses of the project.
Context
S-2700-009
In performing the fixed asset search portion of the audit a large number of meals, travel, mileage, payroll entries
were noted in the various maintenance accounts. Such costs are not considered maintenance costs. Invoices
and credit card receipts for these purchases were requested and reviewed. Reclassification entries were made
to move such costs from the maintenance expense accounts to general and administrative costs and to
payroll accounts. All but one of the credit card receipts for meals were not itemized. None of the credit card
receipts for purchases were signed by an authorized supervisor. The maintenance supervisor for the project
stayed at an expensive coastal resort with his wife rather than the hotel where other maintenance staff lodged.
Expensive meals with alcoholic beverages were purchased and charged to the project. Such meal and lodging
expenses are not reasonable or necessary expenses of the project.
Cause
S-2700-040
Intent on the part of the property management company to increase profits at the expense of this project.
Intentional misclassification of non-project expenses in maintenance costs in an attempt to obscure them.
Effect
S-2700-030
The project ended 2021 in a precarious financial position with less than $12,000 in the operating bank account,
over three months of unpaid vendor invoices accrued as accounts payable totaling $41,867. Much of the cash
depletion was caused by increased maintenance activity in 2021 to prepare for the REAC inspection which
could have been avoided if the property management company maintained the project on a continuous basis.
The unnecessarily expensive meals, mileage, lodging expenses resulted from management company emp-
loyees staying at the coast while working on deferred maintenance items in advance of the REAC inspection.

Questioned Costs
S-2700-065
The following questioned costs were noted during the audit per the criteria listed above. There are likely more
questioned costs as it is not possible to test all transactions. Payroll administrative fee; not allowed per HUD Handbook 4381.5 3,727$
Roving maintenance fee; not allowed per HUD Handbook 4381.5 1,198
Marketing support fee; not allowed per HUD Handbook 4381.5 660

REAC credit card receipts for supplies; not properly substantiated or signed by supervisor 4,847
Edge Networks; Wi-Fi invoiced to the project but services not provided 1,925
Total questioned costs 33,679$
Recommendation
S-2700-050
NWCH should terminate property management services with the present company and engage the services
of another approved HUD property management company. NWCH should carefully review monthly financial
reports and transactions recorded for the project by the management company and promptly investigate any
questionable charges. In addition to the questioned costs listed above, the property management company
should be charged for the increased audit costs required to audit this finding currently estimated at 35 hours
at $150 per hour for total additional audit costs of $5,250.
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions
S-2700-100
We agree with the above finding. The management company terminated services with the project effective
March 20, 2022 and another property management company was interviewed, hired, and began work on
March 21, 2022. The previous property management company was to meet with the new company on March
21, 2022 at noon, but instead arrived early and cleared the administrative and maintenance computers of all
software and data owned by the project, turned off the maintenance cell phone provided by the owner, and
deleted all voicemail from the desktop telephone. Accordingly, this incident of trespassing, data and property
destruction resulted in additional costs to the project by the management company that should be included
in the above questioned costs.

Structures - Assistance Listing No. 14.142
Management Agreement
Criteria S-2700-020
The HUD Audit Guide Chapter 4, Section 5.a. lists provisions that are required in all management agreements
regarding HUD's and the lender's rights concerning the project. The Project's property management agreement
is dated September 1, 2010, subsequently updated to include HUD provisions and the management fee at 5%
with form HUD-9839-B dated July 20, 2015. However, the management agent charged the Project 5.25% when
occupancy exceeded 97%. This provision from the 2010 management agreement was superseded by form
HUD-9839-B which capped the management fee at 5%.
Condition S-2700-010
The management agent continued to charge the Project 5.25% when occupancy exceeded 97% since 2015.
Context
S-2700-009
The management agreement is dated September 1, 2010 and was not updated in 2015 upon financing the
property renovations with a HUD insured loan. However, form HUD-9839-B, Project Owner's/Management
Agent's Certification for Multifamily Housing Projects for Identity-of-Interest or Independent Management
Agents, dated July 20, 2015, established the HUD provisions missing from the 2010 agreement. The form
also provided for a management agent fee of 5% of residential income collected, without an increase to 5.25%
when occupancy exceeded 97%. The management agent continued to charge the Project 5.25% when
occupancy increased to 97% after the form HUD-9839-B took effect in 2015.
Cause S-2700-040
Management agent's failure to abide by form HUD-9839-B that updated the 2010 management agreement
and capped the management fee at 5%.
Effect S-2700-030
The Project was overcharged for management fees since 2015.
Questioned Costs S-2700-065
Recalculating the management fee at 5% results in an overcharge to the Project of $1,572 for 2021, plus the
additional fees charged by the management agent and listed in finding 2021-001 under questioned costs.
Using the overcharge from 2021 of $1,572 times the past 6 years for 2016-2021 results in $9,432 in management fee total questioned costs.
Recommendation S-2700-050
Review the management fee calculation monthly to ensure only the agreed upon amount is paid to the management agent.
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions S-2700-100
We agree with the above finding. The new property management company's management agreement was reviewed by legal counsel and contains the above required HUD provisions.",N,926339,1,,
36658,247591,2021,2021-001,"Finding No. 2021-001
Rural Housing Service Section 515 Rural Rental Housing Loans 
Criteria
According to Government Auditing Standards and Title 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations Part 200,
Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform
Guidance) a deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented
or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.
Condition
Section 515 Rural Rental Housing loans for acquisition of Golden Eagle II Apartments in Tillamook, Oregon
were not recorded in NWCH's books, nor was the associated purchased asset. In addition, other state and
federal cost reimbursement grants that were not reimbursed by year-end were also unrecorded.
Context
The Section 515 Rural Rental Housing loan proceeds were wired directly to escrow at the closing of the
purchased property, as were state grants to purchase another property, resulting in the omission of
associated assets, debt, and grant revenue from the accounting system and financial reports produced from
the accounting system. Cost reimbursement grants not yet reimbursed were not recorded as grants
receivable and revenue. In addition, construction in progress costs of $37,054 were recorded as expenses.
Cause
The transactions discussed above did not go through NWCH's bank accounts and, accordingly, were not
recorded by the bookkeeper. Property purchase closing statements were received but were not recorded in
the books of accounts. Recording of construction in progress costs did not follow the capitalization policy.
Effect
Initial accounting records provided for the audit understated assets by $6,674,442, understated liabilities by
$3,037,712, understated revenue by $3,308,107, and understated the change in net assets by $3,640,875.
These are material omissions that are considered to be material weaknesses in internal control.
Questioned Costs
None.
Recommendation
Provide documentation for all financial transactions (grants, contracts, loans, closing documents, etc.) to
the bookkeeper for recording in the accounting system. Review accounting reports produced by the system
to make sure all assets, debt, grants, and other transactions are present and properly recorded.
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions
We agree with the finding and have contracted with an area firm to provide training for our bookkeeper. We
are hiring for new positions such as program director and housing development director due to our rapid
growth which is expected to continue, which will add more expertise and work hours to our staff.",N,926339,1,,

Grantor: HUD
Questioned Costs: $0
Description of Condition: During the fiscal year the amount of $9,211.50 was drawn from replacement reserves but was
not spent in a timely manner.
Cause of the Condition: The vendor who is installing the flooring in the vacant apartments requires a 50% deposit
before starting work but is generating an invoice for the full project cost at the time he is
requesting the deposit. The 50% deposit is being paid and steps are taken to make sure the
final payment is not made until the work is completed and inspected. When the reserve
request was assembled the full invoices were requested even though the final payment had
not been made. Final payment was not made until after the fiscal year end in payments
ranging from 30 to 60 days after the reserve withdrawal.
Effect of the Condition: There was an unallowed length of time between the reserve withdrawal and the vendor
payment which crossed the fiscal year end.
Recommendations: Management attempt to put in place a system where invoices submitted for replacement
reserve funds can be tracked.
Management Response: They are working on a system to prevent this from happening",N,925142,1,,

33716,246905,2021,2021-001,"Criteria: Pursuant to 2 CFR 200, Health centers must prepare and apply a sliding fee discount schedule (SFDS) so that the amounts owed for health center services by eligible patients are adjusted (discounted) based on the patient’s ability to pay as follows: (a) sliding fee discounts are applied to fees for health center services provided to all individuals and families with annual incomes at or below 200% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines (FPG); (b) a full discount is applied to fees for health center services provided to individuals and families with annual incomes at or below 100% of the FPG, or the health center applies only a nominal charge; (c) fees for health center services are discounted based on gradations in family size and income for individuals and families with incomes above 100 and at or below 200% of the FPG; and (d) no sliding fee discount is applied to fees for health center services provided to individuals and families with annual incomes above 200% of the FPG.
Condition: During the audit procedures, we tested the application of the sliding fee for 60 patient visits during the year. Of the 60 tested, 9 patient applications were unable to be located.
Effect: Not meeting expectation of reliance over internal controls over special tests and provisions and incorrect application of discounts.
Cause: Eligibility documentation obtained by Genesis Health Care, Inc. was not properly entered into the system. Therefore, the information used to apply the sliding fee discount was incorrect.

29831,123503,2021,2021-001,"FINDING 2021-001 – Special Tests and Provisions – Enrollment Reporting – Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance

Criteria: The National Student Loan Data System (NSLDS) is the Department of Education’s (ED) centralized database for students’ enrollment information. It is the University’s responsibility to update this information timely and accurately when the enrollment status of a student that has received federal aid changes. The University is ultimately responsible for the timeliness and accuracy of this information even when a third-party servicer is used as an intermediary to report on the University’s behalf.
The University currently contracts with a third-party servicer and has elected to receive an Enrollment Reporting roster file every 30 days from NSLDS. At a minimum, institutions must certify the enrollment status of all students included on the roster file within 15 days of receiving the roster file. If errors are identified, the University has 10 days to resubmit a corrected response.
Unless the school expects to complete its next roster within 60 days, the school must notify the lender or the guaranty agency within 30 days, if it discovers that a student who received federal aid either did not enroll or ceased to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis (34 CFR section 685.309).
Condition/Context: We selected a sample of students identified by the University as having received some Federal assistance and who either withdrew from the University or graduated from the University during the year ended June 30, 2021. Our sample consisted of 18 students out of a population of approximately 180 that were identified as withdrawn during the year and a sample of 40 students out of a population of approximately 470 that were identified as graduates. We then compared the enrollment
information and withdrawal or graduation date per the University’s records to the information reported to NSLDS. We believe this to be a representative sample of the population. - 1. We noted exceptions with 10 students whereby their status was reported as withdrawn; however, they had graduated, and their status was not updated within the required time frame following their conferral. 2. We also noted exceptions with 9 other students who either had graduated or withdrawn and whose status change was not reported within the required time frame.
Questioned Costs: No questioned costs were identified as part of this finding.
Effect: Enrollment status is utilized by students, ED, the Direct Loan program, lenders, and other institutions to determine in-school status. NSLDS also uses the newly submitted enrollment data to recalculate a student’s 150% limit for direct subsidized loans to determine if loss or protection of the subsidy should occur. Therefore, this significant deficiency in enrollment reporting could result in incorrect future eligibility for undergraduate aid, as well as impact future subsidy loss or protection related to the 150% limit.
Cause: 1. These exceptions occurred as a result of an error in the data transmitted from the University to its third-party servicer. Although subsequent reporting attempted to correct the status, based on the format of the file, students were not updated to reflect a graduated status. Management did not become aware of the incorrect status until after the reporting deadline had become due. 2. These exceptions occurred as a result of transitions within staffing and therefore required additional time to update status change reporting.
Repeat finding: This is not a repeat finding.
Recommendation: We recommend that the University develop additional procedures to monitor the accuracy of information provided by its third-party servicer on behalf of the University to NSLDS. One additional monitoring control could be to review a sample of students within NSLDS after each roster file response to ensure that the enrollment status is accurate. Each institution has access to correct information directly within NSLDS at any time.
Views of responsible officials and planned corrective actions: Management agrees with the findings and recommendation and will continue to compare the data submitted to the third-party processor and ensure that conferrals are processed in a timely manner.",Y,902813,1,,

Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance
Criteria: An institution must submit Pell Grant, Iraq and Afghanistan Service Grant, Direct Loan, and TEACH Grant disbursement records to COD, no later than 15 days after making the disbursement or becoming aware of the need to adjust a previously reported disbursement. In accordance with 34 CFR 668.164(a), Title IV, HEA program funds are disbursed on the date that the institution: (a) credits those funds to a student’s account in the institution’s general ledger or any subledger of the general ledger; or (b) pays those funds to a student directly. Title IV, HEA program funds are disbursed even if an institution uses its own funds in advance of receiving program funds from the Department.
Condition: One instance was noted where Title IV funds were applied to the student account but were not processed in COD within the required timeframe.
Cause: There was a hold placed on the student that prevented the funds from being applied in COD timely.
Effect: COD data was not reflective of the date the aid was applied to the student account.

The University may not withdraw or spend the remaining 50 percent of the endowment fund income without Department of Education permission if 34 CFR 628.45 (b) conditions are met. 34 CFR 628.45(c) requires repayment to the Department of Education of amounts spent in excess of 50 percent of the endowment fund income.
Condition: The University spent more than 50 percent of the endowment fund income without explicit permission from the federal agency.
Cause: The University had proposed a spending rate reduction plan to the Department of Education in 2017, but never received approval or acknowledgement of the spending plan reduction from the Department of Education. The University relied on verbal guidance at that time.
Effect: The University continued to make quarterly distributions and failed to comply with 34 CFR 628.45.
Questioned Costs: $19,436 was withdrawn from endowment fund income in fiscal year 2021.
Cumulative withdraws in excess of 50 percent of endowment fund income are $66,971 as of May 31, 2021.
Context/Sampling: Sampling was not used.
Repeat Finding from Prior Years: No
Recommendation: The University should contact the federal agency for repayment guidance related to the amount withdrawn in excess of 50 percent of endowment fund income and adjust future distributions from the endowment fund to comply with 34 CFR 628.46.

Eligibility
Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance
Criteria: 34 CFR 690.62(a) states that the amount of a student’s Pell Grant for an academic year is based upon the payment and disbursement schedules published by the Secretary for each Award year. 34 CFR 676.20 (a) states that an FSEOG may not be awarded for a full academic year that is less than $100 (34 CFR 676.20(a)(1)) or more than $4,000 (34 CFR 676.20(a)(2)). The limit of $4,000 may be increased to $4,400 in the instance the student is participating in a program of study abroad approved for credit by the home institution (34 CFR 676.20 (c)).
Condition: One instance was identified where the student received more than the maximum allowable SEOG amount, and one instance was identified where the student was awarded Pell based on the 2019-2020 Pell Payment Schedule published by the Department of Education.
Cause: Controls failed to detect and correct two instances where the student was awarded improper aid.
Effect: Two students received federal assistance of an incorrect amount.
Questioned Costs: $695 for Pell was under-awarded and $301 for FSEOG was over-awarded.
Context/Sampling: Non-statistical sampling was performed. Two separate issues were identified in the sample of 68 students selected. 254 students received Pell awards of $1,153,648 and 116 students received FSEOG of $190,366.
Repeat Finding from Prior Years: No
Recommendation: The University should review its current controls to ensure that awards within the limits established for the type of aid awarded.

Reporting
Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance
Criteria: 34 CFR 673.3 requires institutions complete the Fiscal Operations Report and Application to Participate (FISAP) to participate in the Federal Work Study or Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants. The Fiscal Operations Report includes the University’s financial information from the previous award year.
Condition: Certain amounts within the FISAP filed during fiscal year 2020 FISAP were reported incorrectly in Part VI, Section A, Line 26 between columns (c) through (f).
Cause: There was an oversight for certain line items in reporting FSEOG recipients and funds in the Federal Work Study recipients and funds columns.
Effect: Information reported on the FISAP was incorrect.
Questioned Costs: None
Context/Sampling: Key line items within the FISAP report were tested as required by the OMB Compliance Supplement. No statistical sampling was performed.
Repeat Finding from Prior Years: No
Recommendation: The University should review current processes to ensure that documents supporting the FISAP exist and that line items reported are accurate. The FISAP review process should include a detail review by an individual independent from the preparer to verify the numbers reported.

Special Tests & Provisions: Return of Title IV Funds
Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance
Criteria: The unearned amount of Title IV assistance to be returned is calculated by subtracting the amount of Title IV assistance earned by the student from the amount of Title IV aid that was disbursed to the student as of the date of the institution’s determination that the student withdrew (34 CFR 668.22(e)).
Condition: One instance was identified where the Return of Title IV calculation was completed using the incorrect withdrawal date.
Cause: The incorrect withdrawal date was used to calculate the amount of aid to be returned.
Effect: The University should return an additional $1,918 based on the corrected withdrawal date.
Questioned Costs: $1,918
Context/Sampling: All students in which a Return of Title IV funds were calculated. The University returned funds totaling $57,884 for 10 students.
Repeat Finding from Prior Years: No
Recommendation: The University should review its current controls over Return of Title IV calculations to ensure that errors are detected and corrected timely.

Special Tests & Provisions: Disbursements to or on Behalf of Students
Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance
Criteria: The University is required to maintain internal control to ensure the student’s wages are earned when the work is performed, and the student is paid at least once per month. The federal share must be paid by check or similar instrument the student can cash on his or her endorsement, or as authorized by the student, by crediting FWS funds to a student’s account or by EFT to a bank account designated by the student. The institution may only credit the account for tuition, fees, institutional room and board, and other institution-provided goods and services (34 CFR 675.16).
Condition: The spreadsheet utilized by the University included wages paid to a student, but there was no payment in the payroll system or supporting timesheet indicating that the student performed work.
Cause: There were data entry errors made when compiling the spreadsheet.
Effect: Failure to keep accurate records could result in compliance issues.
Questioned Costs: None. The input errors did not result in incorrect aid being awarded.
Context/Sampling: Non-statistical sampling was performed. 9 of the 68 students selected for purposes of eligibility testing received Federal Work Study. The University disbursed $83,358 of federal work study to 96 students.
Repeat Finding from Prior Years: No
Recommendation: The University should review its current controls over Federal Work Study tracking to ensure that spreadsheet is compare to data within the payroll system for accuracy.

31762,161196,2021,2021-003,"Criteria: According to Board policy 8300, effective accounting, financial reporting, and management control systems will be designed, maintained, and periodically reviewed to (a) enable the board and school system to have access to accurate, reliable, and relevant data; (b) provide assurance that school system obligations are paid in a timely manner and that accounts are not overspent; (c) provide assurance that fund and records are safeguarded at all times; and (d) permit audits and periodic reports adequate to show that those in charge have handled funds within legal requirements and in accordance with Board policy.
Condition: During our testing of bank reconciliations, it was noted that reconciliations are not being prepared properly or timely. It was also noted that reconciliations are not being reviewed in a timely manner. Furthermore, it was noted during testing of cash that deposits are not being entered into the accounting system in a timely manner.
Effect: The possibility exists that financial transactions may not be accurate, reliable, and relevant due to the lack of cash controls.
Cause: Board policies and procedures were not followed.
Questioned Costs: There are no questioned costs associated with this finding.
Context: We reviewed all bank reconciliations prepared during the year for all funds, noting reconciliation date and date of review. We reviewed the June 2021 bank reconciliations for all funds in detail as a part of testing cash balances.
Recommendation: I recommend that Board policy 8300 and procedures put in place due to Board policies be followed to ensure proper and timely reconciliation of all bank accounts, as well as timely recording of all deposits.
Views of responsible officials and planned corrective actions: Bank reconciliations are done monthly at the school level and submitted to the CFO. The CFO reviews and submits to the Deputy Finance Officer to reconcile the district accounts. All bank statements come to the CFO and forwarded to the Deputy Finance Officer. The reconciliations are done and loaded to a shared drive in Google. The breakdown is getting the receipts entered into the financial software system. Effective 12-1-21 the CFO will enter all receipts and deposits for all funds except for fund 5. This will ensure timely recording of deposits into the system.

SIGNIFICANT DEFICIENCY
Eligibility
Criteria: Per the NC Department of Health and Human Services-Division of Health Benefits, the County Department of Social Services Agency is responsible to determine client eligibility in accordance with eligibility requirements defined in the approved State Plan (42 CFR Section 431.10).
An applicant/beneficiary (a/b) whose net countable income exceeds the income limit must meet a deductible before he may be authorized for Medicaid.
Condition: One case file did not have documentation for determining deductible amount.
Cause: The caseworker did not correctly include the proper documentation in the case file. 
Effect: Case file did not have the proper documentation, which could allow benefits to be provided to individuals who are not eligible. Questioned Costs:  There were no known effects to eligibility and there were no known questioned costs.
Context: We examined 91 Medicaid applicants from the Medicaid Beneficiary report provided by NC Department of Health and Human Services to re-determine eligibility. These findings are being reported with the financial statement audit as it relates to the Medicaid administrative cost compliance audit.
Identification of a repeat finding: This is not a repeat finding from the immediate previous audit.
Recommendation: Files should be reviewed internally to ensure proper information is in place and necessary procedures are taken when determine eligibility. The results found or documentation made in case notes should clearly indicate what actions were performed and the results of those actions.

U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
Moving to Work Demonstration Program - ALN 14.881
Reporting	

Condition:  During our review of HUD-50058, Family Report (OMB No. 2577-0083) (HUD-50058) forms prepared by the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (Authority) as part of the biennial reexamination process, we noted thirteen forms out of a sample of 60 that required corrections subsequent to the original form being processed and/or did not have the required documentation to support the income calculation, due to a lack of functioning internal controls.  In all cases of a required correction, the corrections resulted in changes to family income or in calculated rental/housing assistance payments and the corrections were not made in a timely manner.  Of the thirteen HUD-50058 forms noted, five forms related to the MTW - Low Income Public Housing Program, and eight forms were related to the MTW - Housing Choice Voucher Program.

Criteria:  The Authority is required to prepare and submit HUD-50058 form each time the Authority completes an admission, annual reexamination, portability move-in, or other change of unit for a family.  The form provides HUD and the Authority with vital eligibility data for each program participant such as family composition, family income, the assets and liabilities of program participants, and ultimately provides for the calculation of tenant rent and rental/housing assistance payments for each program participant. 

Cause:  During the year, the Authority experienced turnover within several key positions, coupled with other logistical staffing challenges brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Effect:  HUD-50058 forms provide essential information to HUD and assist with the determination of program eligibility.  In addition, the HUD-50058 form provides for the calculation of tenant rent and rental/housing assistance payments.  A lack of functioning internal controls led to inaccurate HUD-50058 forms.  This, combined with the untimely detection of inaccuracies, could result in program participants or HUD being over or under charged tenant rent for an extended period.   

Questioned Costs: Unknown

Identification as a Repeat Finding: This is a repeat of finding 2020-001 from the prior year audit.

Recommendation: We recommend that the Authority implement additional procedures to ensure HUD-50058 forms are prepared accurately and that errors are detected and corrected in timely manner.  In addition, appropriate training and planning should be performed to ensure that future turnover in the organization does not lead to a lapse in internal controls over compliance.

Views of responsible officials and planned corrective action:  Management agrees with the finding. See separate corrective action plan.

Criteria or specific requirement: 
As per § 200.318 General procurement standards.
(a) The Non-Federal entity must have and use documented procurement procedures, consistent with State, and local, laws and regulations and the standards of this section, for the acquisition of property or services required under a Federal award or subaward. The non-Federal entity's documented procurement procedures must conform to the procurement standards identified in §§ 200.317 through 200.327. 
(b) Non-Federal entities must maintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions, and specifications of their contracts or purchase orders. 
 (c) The Non-Federal entity's procedures must avoid acquisition of unnecessary or duplicative items. Consideration should be given to consolidating or breaking out procurements to obtain a more economical purchase. Where appropriate, an analysis will be made of lease versus purchase alternatives, and any other appropriate analysis to determine the most economical approach. 
(d) To foster greater economy and efficiency, and in accordance with efforts to promote cost-effective use of shared services across the Federal Government, the non-Federal entity is encouraged to enter into state and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of common or shared goods and services. Competition requirements will be met with documented procurement actions using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other similar procurement arrangements. 
(e) The Non-Federal entity must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price. 
Condition:

Based on our review of the Procurement compliance requirements, we noted that the Division did not have Written procurement policies and competitive policies as required by CFR § 200.318 General procurement standards. We selected five vendors for procurement compliance  testing and we were not provided with written procurement policies and Procurement comparative policies, therefore, we were unable:

(1)	To verify that the procurement method used was appropriate based on the dollar amount and conditions specified in 2 CFR section 200.320.
(2)	To Verify that procurements provide full and open competition (2 CFR section 200.319 and 48 CFR section 52.244-5).
(3)	To examine documentation in support of the rationale to limit competition in those cases where competition was limited and ascertain if the limitation was justified  (2 CFR sections 200.319 and 200.320(f) and 48 CFR section 52.244-5).
Cause:
The Division did not ensure that as a non-Federal entity must have and must use documented procurement procedures, consistent with State, and local  laws and regulations and the standards of §§ 200.318 through 200.327, for the acquisition of property or services required under a Federal award or subaward. 
Effect:

The funding agency can reject the expenditures incurred by the Division on certain vendors where the Division must use procurement method appropriately based on the dollar amount and conditions specified in 2 CFR section 200.320.

Questioned costs:

Cannot be determined

Recommendation:

We recommend that the Division must:

(1)	document procurement procedures, consistent with State, and local, laws and regulations and the standards, for the acquisition of property or services required under a federal award or subaward. 
(2)	The Division’s documented procurement procedures must conform to the procurement standards identified in §§ 200.318 through 200.327.
Views of responsible officials:

The Division will work with Territorial Headquarters to document procedures as outlined in the Recommendations above.

DAODAS is the primary grantor to SBHS. By letter to SBHS from DAODAS dated July 1, 2021 DAODAS identified the following:
1)	SBHS did not deliver any prevention programs, a condition of the grant agreement, since February 2021, 
2)	Treatment and associated charges at the SBHS women’s residential facility are not in compliance with grant terms and conditions. This condition has likely resulted in:
a.	A violation of SBHS facility license from South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.
b.	Likely improper billing for Medicaid patient services due to Medicaid residential treatment notes likely not complying with minimum standards. This condition could result in recoupment of Medicaid payments.
3)	Staffing levels across all treatment programs might not be adequate to provide quality care to the individuals served in both outpatient and residential levels of care.
4)	DOADAS has questioned certain billing activity and lack of billing activity in certain areas of service.

Criteria: Federal and state regulations including the grant contract between DAODAS and SBHS.

Context, Cause and Effect: Based upon the above and SBHS is at risk of increased oversight and denial of grant requests / draws for performance of services.

Cause: There was a different management agent during the years of initial application for
some of the tenants tested and therefore unable to obtain such documents.
Recommendation: Ensure all required documents are kept in applicable tenant files.
Response: The management company is aware of the requirements to maintain original
eligibility documentation in the resident files. Such documentation is maintained for all
residents that have moved in since the current management company began
management. The finding was a result of an original resident move-in which was
processed by the original management company. We were unable to locate the

Condition:  The Committee had obligated funds available to satisfy period expenditures but failed to make the drawdown of funds before the program had expired.  $88,970 in 2020 funds and $110,762 in 2021 funds which had been obligated were allowed to expire.

Criteria:  Obligated funds should be drawn down prior to program expiration in order to satisfy legitimate period expenses.

Effect:  The Committee was left without funds to pay legitimate liabilities of the program.

Condition:  The Committee paid prior year expenditures using current year funds.  In the 2021 year $88,970 of 2020 expenses were paid using 2021 funds.  In the 2022 fiscal year, $247,799 of 2021 expenses were paid with 2022 funds.

$137,037 of the 2022 funds were replaced when the final 2021 drawdown was made.

Criteria:  Funding regulations require only current year expenditures be paid with current year revenues unless remaining funds are reallocated to a future period.  In no circumstances is it permissible to pay prior year expenses with current year funds.

Effect:  Funding for the current year is less than originally budgeted since the available current year funds were reduced by the amount paid for prior year expenses.

Recommendation:  Procedures currently in place should be augmented by inclusion of second party involvement in the drawdown process.  Current controls are in place for the drawdown funds to be traced to the bank account, however, the error was caused by the drawdown not being done timely to coincide with the disbursements.  In both of these cases the attempted drawdowns were not made until the programs had expired.

1.	In three (3) instances out of three (3) tenant files tested, the security deposit was refunded without interest.

Criteria: 

HUD 4350.3, REV-1, Change 4, Ch. 5, 5-12.B. 

Timeframe for Conducting Verifications.  Verifications should be conducted at the following three times.  1. Owners must verify income, assets, expenses, and deductions and all eligibility requirements prior to move-in.  2. Owners must verify each family’s income, assets, expenses, and deductions as part of the annual recertification process.  3. Owners must verify changes in income, allowances, or family characteristics reported between annual recertification. 

HUD Handbook 4350.3, Rev 1, Change 4, Ch. 5, 5-31, F. 

In all cases, the computer generated HUD-50059 must include the required tenant signatures and owner signatures prior to submitting the data to the Contract Administrator or HUD.  The owner must document within the file why the signature(s) was not obtained and, if applicable, when the signature(s) will be obtained. 24 CFR §891.400(b): The Owner is responsible for all management functions. These functions include selection and admission of tenants, required reexaminations of incomes for households occupying assisted units or residential spaces, collection of tenant payments, termination of tenancy and eviction.

HUD 4350.3 REV-1, Change 4, Ch. 6: 6-29.A. 

Owners perform unit inspections on at least an annual basis to determine whether the appliances and equipment in the unit are functioning properly and to assess whether a component needs to be repaired or replaced. This is also an opportunity to determine any damage to the unit caused by the tenant's abuse or negligence and, if so, make the necessary repairs and bill the tenant for the cost of the repairs.

HUD Handbook 4350.3, REV-1, Change 4, Ch 6 6-18 C. 

Within 30 days after the move-out date (or shorter time if required by state and/or local laws), the owner must either:  1. Refund the full security deposit plus accrued interest to a tenant that does not owe any amounts under the lease; or  2. Provide the tenant with an itemized list of any unpaid rent, damages to the unit, and an estimated cost for repair, along with a statement of the tenant’s rights under state and local laws. 

In addition, prior to the tenant occupying the unit the following procedures should be performed:

1.	The security deposit amount per the lease agreement should agree to the security deposit agreement.
2.	Obtain the tenant’s social security card.
3.	Date stamp the tenant application.
4.	 Obtain the tenant’s signature on the Notice and Consent for the Release of Information (Form 9887) and maintained the document in the tenant’s file.
5.	The management agent should sign the Applicant's/Tenant's Consent to the Release of Information (Form 9887-A), in addition to obtaining the tenant signature, and maintain the document in the tenant’s file.
6.	The management agent should verify that the effective date of the 50059 agrees with the date on the lease agreement.
7.	The management agent should sign the Lease Addendum, for Violence Against Women and Justice Department Reauthorization Act of 2005, in addition to obtaining the tenant signature, and maintain the document in the tenant’s file.
8.	The management agent must determine the tenant’s rent based on the proper verification of the tenant’s income.

Effect:

The tenant files were not always in compliance with the guidelines established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  

Cause:

Required documents were not always maintained in the tenant file, in addition to being properly authorized by the tenant and/or owner. 

Context:

Tenant files tested consisted of move-ins, recertifications and move-outs.

Items Not in Compliance

Number: 17 Tenant Files.				Dollar Amount: $  65.60.

Questioned Costs

There was no questioned costs.

Recommendation:

In order to be in compliance with guidelines established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, I recommend that Alpha Tower process applicants and tenants, including recertification of tenants in accordance with guidelines established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development prior to the tenant occupying the unit.  In addition, security deposits should be refunded with interest, within 30-day after the effective move-out date.  By performing these procedures, the risk of incurring questioned costs will be significantly reduced.

Condition:  Material adjusting entries were prepared to ensure the financial statements were presented fairly.  Cause:  The Entity lacks the training to apply generally accepted accounting principles in recording the transactions to the general ledger.  Effect:  The possibility exists that the general ledger does not reflect generally accepted accounting principles.,N,926254,1,,
35653,243881,2021,2021-002,"Criteria: According to 2 CFR 200.403(g) costs must be adequately documented.

Condition: During our testing of payroll costs charged to the grant we noted variances between timesheet reports used to support the cost and actual cost charged to the grant.  We selected 5 of 12 total months during the fiscal year, and variances were noted in 2 pay periods tested. The actual amount charged to the grant was lower than the timesheet report by a combined total of $511. Additionally, manual level-of-effort factors were applied to various employee charges which were not based off of timesheet data. No supporting documentation for these variances could be provided.

Cause: Per discussion with Management, the variances resulting in a miscalculation of grant charges resulted from a transposition error of timesheet data to the Excel sheet used to calculate the grant charge. Level-of-effort factors were applied as certain employees were not aware they were required to track time between federal and nonfederal projects.

Effect: The payroll-related grant charge for one month during the fiscal year was miscalculated. Additionally, no supporting documentation was created or maintained to support the manual level-of-effort adjustments.

Repeat Finding: Not a repeat finding. 

Recommendation: We recommend that the Organization establish controls and documentation polices around the review of payroll costs. If errors are noted during the review process and corrections needed, changes should be adequately documented. Changes in employee timesheets should be reviewed and approved by the employee and the reviewer. Supporting documentation must be maintained. Lastly, the Organization should consider utilization of an automated labor costing system. Tracking labor charges in Excel is prone to transposition and calculation errors.

Views of Responsible Officials and Corrective Action Plan (unaudited): Shelter House is looking at several options.  First, we plan to work with a consultant to see if the allocations can be more automated.  If that is not possible, we may have to add or switch capacity so that one person does the allocations and another on the team reviews and signs off on the allocations.

Condition: During our testing of vendor procurement compliance, we noted price quotations were not obtained for a vendor with aggregate purchases exceeding the micro-purchase threshold. 

Cause: Per discussion with Management, staff were not aware of the requirement to aggregate vendor purchases in determining procurement compliance thresholds.

Effect: The auditee did not obtain price quotations for purchases from a vendor exceeding the micro-purchase threshold as required by 2 CFR 200.320(a)(2).

Condition: 2 CFR Part 200, section 200.510 requires the Corporation to prepare a schedule of expenditures of federal awards (SEFA) for the period covered by the financial statements. We noted that expenditures related to the Corporation’s grant program were not recorded in the financial statements nor on a SEFA.
Criteria: An entity that expends federal awards must have controls in place that would enable the entity to prepare a SEFA including controls that determine the accuracy of the amount of expenditures reported for each federal program.
Cause: The Corporation received a new federal program which wasn’t included on the SEFA.
Effect: The lack of an accurate and complete SEFA could lead to grant noncompliance and noncompliance with Subpart F, Audit Requirements, of 2 CFR Part 200.
Recommendation: We recommend management and staff complete annual training related to single audits and the preparation of the SEFA.
Management’s Response (Unaudited): Management agrees with Finding 2021-003 and will ensure that management and staff receive annual training relating to single audits and the preparation of the SEFA.

Criteria   Per the Provider Relief Fund General and Targeted Distribution Post Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements dated June 11, 2021, recipients may choose to apply PRF payments towards lost revenues using one of three options, up to the amount:

Option i: of the difference between actual patient care revenues;

Option ii: of the difference between budgeted (prior to March 27, 2020) and actual patient care revenues; or 

Option iii: calculated by any reasonable methodology of estimating revenues. 
Condition   The Corporation's controls in place for reporting submissions did not identify that Post Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements guidelines were not followed related to the lost revenue calculations. The Holy Family Memorial (HFM) Period 1 reporting submission and the Period 1 and Period 2 reporting submissions for St. Joseph Elder Services (SJES) for lost revenue did not follow the acceptable options provided by the HHS. 
Questioned Costs   None
Identification of How Questioned Costs Were Computed   N/A   Refer to context below for additional information. 
Context   The single audit for the Corporation comprises 4 entities, Holy Family Memorial (HFM), Fransican Care Services (FCS), St. Paul Elder Services (SPES) and St. Joseph Elder Services. For these four entities, there were a total of 6 portal submissions during the period under audit. There were two portal submissions (Period 1 and Period 2) required and submitted for SPES, and SJES, and one portal submission (Period 1) required and submitted for HFM and FCS.

The HFM Period 1 reporting submission and the Period 1 and Period 2 reporting submissions for SJES for lost revenue did not follow the acceptable options provided by the HHS, as noted in the criteria, above.  HFM and SJES had reported to HHS that they used option ii to calculate their their lost revenue included in their portal submissions. However, the budgeted amounts for patient care revenue relating to the periods in calendar year 2021 were not approved prior to March 27, 2020, therefore, option ii was not allowable. The Corporation should have selected option iii in its portal submissions. Finally, by not selecting option iii in the HFM and SJES portal submissions, HFM and SJES omitted required information related to the reason for selecting option iii in their submissions.  
Cause and Effect   Appropriate review of the reporting submissions was not completed to ensure the reports followed required guidelines. As a result, the Corporation submitted incorrect reports, attesting to using an incorrect methodology for reporting lost revenues. Additionally, because the Corporation attested to using option ii, they did not provide the additional information to HHS that would have been required if option iii would have been selected correctly. This additional information includes an explanation for the reason the Corporation used option iii for reporting lost revenue. 
Recommendation   We recommend that the Corporation implement controls, including levels of review, to ensure that reports are completed and submitted in accordance with the guidelines established by HHS. 
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions   The Corporation will review its processes surrounding the methodologies used to report lost revenue and will implement additional levels of review to ensure that the proper lost revenue methodology is used in future reporting periods.

Criteria   In order to comply with program rules, non federal entities must establish and maintain effective internal controls over the federal award, as described in 2 CFR 200.303(a). For Provider Relief Funding, the terms and conditions of the grant, according to HHS, require that the Corporation report certain information accurately into the HHS portal in order to attest to the utilization of the funding received. Specifically, the HHS June 11, 2021 post payment reporting notice has specific information on the net patient service revenue (NPSR) amounts to be reported. These amounts are either to be reported in annual aggregate totals, or quarterly, using one of three options. 
Condition   The Corporation did not follow the reporting requirements as outlined in the  HHS June 11, 2021 post payment reporting notice. The Corporation's controls in place were not adequate to prevent the entry of incorrect net patient service revenue (NPSR) annual and quarterly totals for some of the Corporation's affiliates, as required by HHS. 
Questioned Costs   None
Identification of How Questioned Costs Were Computed   N/A   Refer to context below for additional information. 
Context   The single audit for the Corporation comprises 4 entities, Holy Family Memorial (HFM), Fransican Care Services (FCS), St. Paul Elder Services (SPES) and St. Joseph Elder Services. For these four entities, there were a total of 6 portal submissions during the period under audit. There were two portal submissions (Period 1 and Period 2) required and submitted for SPES and SJES, and one portal submission (Period 1) required and submitted for HFM and FCS. 

The portal submission for HFM included incorrect quarterly revenue information. The actual amount of NPSR reported for HFM reported in the portal submission for the first and second quarter of 2021 was overstated by $2,151,541 and $3,774,656, respectively, causing HFM to underreport lost revenue by $5,926,197.

In addition, the HHS June 11, 2021 post payment reporting notice requires entities that are not required to enter quarterly lost revenue amounts to support the provider relief funds earned to report annual totals for NPSR for certain calendar years. The amounts required to be reported for the Period 1 submission are NPSR totals for calendar year 2019 and calendar year 2020. The amounts required to be reported for the Period 2 submission are NPSR totals for calendar year 2019, calendar year 2020 and calendar year 2021. This information is not factored into the calculation of provider relief funding earned by the entity reporting the information. The information entered for SPES total NPSR for calendar year 2019 and calendar year 2020 in SPES's Period 1 portal submission were not accurate. The amounts were understated by $176,147 and $2,525,495, respectively. Additionally, for the Period 2 portal submission for SPES, the NPSR for calendar year 2019 and calendar year 2021 were not accurate. The amounts for calendar year 2019 were understated by $255,688 and the amounts for calendar year 2021 were overstated by $2,198. 
Cause and Effect   The Corporation's procedures and controls did not prevent the entry of inaccurate NPSR amounts from being entered into the HHS portal. As a result of the incorrect information being entered, the Corporation has under reported the amount of lost revenue it has incurred during the period of allowability for the Period 1 portal submission. Additionally, total SPES NPSR for the calendar years noted in the context are not accurately stated. 
Recommendation   We recommend the Corporation implement controls, including levels of review, to ensure that the information submitted into the HHS portal is accurate. 
Views of Responsible Officials and Corrective Action Plan   The Corporation will review the processes surrounding HHS portal submission to ensure the appropriate levels of review and reconciliation are in place to prevent the issue from recurring.
