FINDINGS- Federal Awards
Finding 2021-001: Matching requirements
Condition: Records provided  to comply with the five percent  non-Federal  WIPA match requirement were not based on actual costs and expected volunteer hours planned for the match requirement did not occur.
Action Taken:
Due to the continuing pandemic, planned in-person events and meetings were cancelled due to COVID
protocols.  Volunteer time and meeting space in-kind donations were unavailable to meet the match. Management  used the fair market  value of its time as match.  The calculation  of fair market value should not have been used for the match, only actual cost.  As a result, Disability Rights Pennsylvania fell short of its match requirements for WIIPA.
Management will recalculate our match based on actual costs.  WIPA has removed the match requirement for FY 22-26.  Management will monitor any other match requirements to calculate based on actual costs not fair market  value.    Management  will report  the  recalculated  match to Maher Duessel.  Management will complete this task by July 18, 2022.

55611,258004,2021,2021-001,"2021-001:  Material Weakness in Internal Control; Material Noncompliance – Reporting

Finding:  The Health System did not complete the PRF portal reporting in accordance with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidance. During our testing of the Period 1 and Period 2 consolidated PRF reports for the Health System, we observed the following exceptions: 

•	The Health System did not submit the required stand-alone reporting for the period 2 targeted distribution for St. Barnabas Nursing Home related to infection control payments. The infection control payments were instead reported on the consolidated Health System period 2 portal submission as Other Assistance. 
•	The Health System had calculated and maintained supporting documentation for lost revenues for both periods 1 and 2. However, lost revenue was never reported on the period 1 and period 2 portal submissions as intended.
•	The expenses reported in the portal and applied to the PRF payments for periods 1 and 2 could not be reconciled to the Health System’s records (i.e., general ledger detail). However, the combined amount of lost revenue and eligible expenses per the Health System’s records was greater than PRF payments received. 

The underlying populations and support for the Health System’s expenses and lost revenue records were subjected to testing. The issues observed above related to inability to reconcile what was provided as part of the audit to what was submitted as part of the required reporting at the time it was completed. 

This was not a statistically valid sample.

Corrective Actions Planned:  Management has reviewed the reporting responsibilities and has redesignated the individual responsible for preparing the reporting. As a result of the change in responsibilities, Management has reviewed the updated PRF terms and conditions, specifically those related to reporting expenses and lost revenues in the PRF portal. In so doing, management will work with HRSA to correct the period 1 and period 2 reports to properly reflect the corrected amounts. Further, an additional review process will be put into place to mitigate the risk of future PRF non-compliance and ensure accurate portal submission reporting.  

Expected Date of Completion: 
•	Redesignation of individual responsible for preparing the reporting (Completed 3/8/2023)
•	Review of updated PRF terms and conditions (Completed 3/8/2023)
•	Correction of period 1 and period 2 reports (Projected Completion To be Determined – based on HRSA guidance)
•	Implementation of review process (Completed 3/8/2023)

Finding Summary:  During the testing over the reporting for the HEERF student and institutional funds, the reports that were required to be filed during the fiscal year were not filed by the required timeframe.

Responsible Individuals: Director of Budgeting; HEERF Operations and Policy Analyst 

Corrective Action Plan: Management agrees with this finding. The University has resolved the delinquent status of the reporting for periods during fiscal year 2020-21 as of September 2021. In October 2021, the University hired a HEERF Operations and Policy Analyst (Analyst) to oversee the HEERF compliance requirements including reporting.

Special Tests and Provisions:  NSLDS Withdrawal Date
Significant Deficiency in Internal Controls over Compliance

Finding Summary:  During the testing of students that were disbursed financial aid during the 2020-21 school year, there were four instances in which the student’s status change date per University records did not match the dates reported to NSLDS.

Responsible Individuals: Director of Financial Aid.

Corrective Action Plan: Management agrees with this finding. The Assistant Director of Financial Aid processes
official withdrawals from the university and uses only one date—namely, the date the student initiated their
withdrawal from WOU which is then picked up for reporting to the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) from
the Registrar; NSC then reports the same date to NSLDS. However, there have been issues with the reporting
either not being done at all or the incorrect date being reported by the Registrar’s Office. There have been no
findings on the R2T4 calculation performed by the Financial Aid Office.

Unofficial withdrawal dates are added to NSLDS by the Financial Aid Office but there are no findings with
reporting dates to NSLDS. The Financial Aid Office typically uses a course’s last day of attendance reported by
faculty, to determine the student’s last day of attendance which is then used for reporting to NSLDS.

The Office of Financial Aid will design a process with the Registrar to ensure that, where exceptions between
two dates occur, that the Registrar’s Office is picking up the correct reporting date.

Section C. MAJOR FEDERAL AWARD PROGRAM AUDIT

Major Program
CFDA 66.468 EPA Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund Cluster

2021-001 WRITTEN POLICIES NEED ADDITIONAL ELEMENTS

Criteria
Written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct are required by 2 CFR 200, Subparts D and E (2 CFR sections 200.300 and 200.400, respectively). The regulations require that the Water System follow their written policies and procedures, including procurement and purchasing, and that they must comply with federal regulations for such transactions and contracts.

The following sections of the Uniform Guidance require nonfederal entities that receive federal awards to establish written policies, procedures, or standards of conduct:

•	Financial management (200.302)
•	Payment (200.305)
•	General procurement standards (200.318)
•	Competition (200.319)
•	Methods of procurement to be followed (200.320)
•	Cost price analysis on items for procurement actions in excess of simplified acquisition threshold (200.323)
•	Suspension and debarment (180.220)

Condition
In 2021, the Water system’s written policies, procedures, and standards of conduct, specifically applicable for this major federal award program, did not include all procedures covering procurement and purchasing. Although the Water System appears to have acted in a manner that ensured compliance with other requirements, the written policies do not appear to include sufficient details to clearly address all of the elements required by federal regulations. 

Cause
The regulations are complex.

Effect
While it appears that the Water System has complied with other compliance requirements, the lack of sufficient written policies and procedures could lead to other instances of noncompliance.

Questioned Costs
I did not identify any questioned costs.

Perspective
The condition is a systemic problem. The project has a budget of $1,150,000. This is funded under the loan program, where the Water System is a subrecipient of funds flowing through Louisiana Department of Health. 

First Year
2021

Recommendation
I recommend that the Water System compare written policies and procedures to federal regulations and include further details where necessary to ensure compliance with the regulations requiring written policies and to prevent noncompliance with other regulations.

Action Taken
The Atlanta Water System, Inc. had written policies. These policies were being followed and we felt we were complying with state and federal requirements for procurement and purchasing.  Upon being made aware policies were required to be written in greater detail related to federal regulations, we amended our written policies and procedures to include such language as required.

56675,190034,2021,2021-002,"Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions: The 2020 annual audit was
submitted by the due date, but due to an error inputting the EIN, the audit could not be accessed
using the correct EIN as a search criterion. However, the audit was accessible when searching
under other search modes.
The 2021 audit was not submitted timely because of delays in the readiness of providing certain
information for auditing purposes. The delays are attributable to staff turnover and the inability to
attract experienced staff due to the labor shortage associated with the pandemic. Within weeks of
the start of fiscal year 2021, the two most experienced finance staff members resigned. To fill the
vacancies quickly, the Authority used staff members from a third-party consultant for key financial
functions. However, the experience and degree of familiarity of these staffers did not match the
levels of those who resigned. Additionally, with the involvement of as many as 9 different staff
members performing the functions of two positions (Accounting Manager and Senior Accountant)
for fiscal year 2021, it was difficult to have consistent processes and results.
After several unsuccessful attempts to fill finance department vacancies with experienced staff,
the Authority was able to rehire as Accounting Manager one of the more experienced finance staff
members who previously resigned. This staff addition has proved valuable in ensuring the
accuracy and timeliness of financial information and reports. Financial reports are again issued
timely and account balances are now reconciled and accurate. Additionally, to mitigate the impact
of future unplanned vacancies, the Finance Department has undertaken efforts to cross-train
employees in the more critical and essential accounting and financial functions. Therefore, in the
event of unplanned vacancies, those functions will continue with minimal disruptions. Moreover,
critical functions have been documented in detail to serve as a how to guide to further enhance and
expedite the employee training and transition process.
The Data Collection Form and Reporting Package was submitted to the Federal Audit
Clearinghouse as soon as the report was final. With the addition of experienced staff, future audits
should not be delayed.

Equity Skimming
Criteria
S-2700-020
The HUD Audit Guide defines equity skimming as the ""willful misuse of any part of the rent, assets, proceeds,
income, or other funds derived from the project covered by the mortgage for any purpose other than to meet the
actual or necessary expenses of the project."" Specific criteria for unnecessary costs noted during the audit
include Uniform Guidance section 200.423 that excludes purchases of alcoholic beverages, HUD Handbook
4370.2 Rev.1 supporting documentation for expense reimbursements must be itemized invoices/receipts with
an authorized signature, HUD Management Agent Handbook 4381.5 the agent may not impose administrative
fees in addition to actual payroll costs; agent's travel expenses to visit the project or meet with owners are to
be paid from the management fee as is training and travel expenses for agent's supervisory staff; pay reasonable
expenses necessary for the operation and maintenance of the project.
Condition
S-2700-010
""Equity skimming deprives the project of needed funds for repairs, maintenance, and improvements, which
contributes to the financial and physical deterioration of the project and the standard of living conditions for the
families who depend on the federal government to provide housing."" The audit uncovered a variety of costs
charged to the project by the property management company that are either specifically excluded expenses
per federal regulations cited above or are simply not necessary or actual expenses of the project.
Context
S-2700-009
In performing the fixed asset search portion of the audit a large number of meals, travel, mileage, payroll entries
were noted in the various maintenance accounts. Such costs are not considered maintenance costs. Invoices
and credit card receipts for these purchases were requested and reviewed. Reclassification entries were made
to move such costs from the maintenance expense accounts to general and administrative costs and to
payroll accounts. All but one of the credit card receipts for meals were not itemized. None of the credit card
receipts for purchases were signed by an authorized supervisor. The maintenance supervisor for the project
stayed at an expensive coastal resort with his wife rather than the hotel where other maintenance staff lodged.
Expensive meals with alcoholic beverages were purchased and charged to the project. Such meal and lodging
expenses are not reasonable or necessary expenses of the project.
Cause
S-2700-040
Intent on the part of the property management company to increase profits at the expense of this project.
Intentional misclassification of non-project expenses in maintenance costs in an attempt to obscure them.
Effect
S-2700-030
The project ended 2021 in a precarious financial position with less than $12,000 in the operating bank account,
over three months of unpaid vendor invoices accrued as accounts payable totaling $41,867. Much of the cash
depletion was caused by increased maintenance activity in 2021 to prepare for the REAC inspection which
could have been avoided if the property management company maintained the project on a continuous basis.
The unnecessarily expensive meals, mileage, lodging expenses resulted from management company emp-
loyees staying at the coast while working on deferred maintenance items in advance of the REAC inspection.

Recommendation

NWCH should terminate property management services with the present company and engage the services
of another approved HUD property management company. NWCH should carefully review monthly financial
reports and transactions recorded for the project by the management company and promptly investigate any
questionable charges. In addition to the questioned costs listed above, the property management company
should be charged for the increased audit costs required to audit this finding currently estimated at 35 hours
at $150 per hour for total additional audit costs of $5,250.
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions

We agree with the above finding. The management company terminated services with the project effective
March 20, 2022 and another property management company was interviewed, hired, and began work on
March 21, 2022. The previous property management company was to meet with the new company on March
21, 2022 at noon, but instead arrived early and cleared the administrative and maintenance computers of all
software and data owned by the project, turned off the maintenance cell phone provided by the owner, and
deleted all voicemail from the desktop telephone. Accordingly, this incident of trespassing, data and property
destruction resulted in additional costs to the project by the management company that should be included
in the above questioned costs.

Finding No. 2021-003
Property Improvement Loan Insurance for Improving All Existing Structures and Building of New Nonresidential
Structures - Assistance Listing No. 14.142
Management Agreement
Criteria
The HUD Audit Guide Chapter 4, Section 5.a. lists provisions that are required in all management agreements
regarding HUD's and the lender's rights concerning the project. The Project's property management agreement
is dated September 1, 2010, subsequently updated to include HUD provisions and the management fee at 5%
with form HUD-9839-B dated July 20, 2015. However, the management agent charged the Project 5.25% when
occupancy exceeded 97%. This provision from the 2010 management agreement was superceded by form
HUD-9839-B which capped the management fee at 5%.
Condition
The management agent continued to charge the Project 5.25% when occupancy exceeded 97% since 2015.
Context
The management agreement is dated September 1, 2010 and was not updated in 2015 upon financing the
property renovations with a HUD insured loan. However, form HUD-9839-B, Project Owner's/Management
Agent's Certification for Multifamily Housing Projects for Identity-of-Interest or Independent Management
Agents, dated July 20, 2015, established the HUD provisions missing from the 2010 agreement. The form
also provided for a management agent fee of 5% of residential income collected, without an increase to 5.25%
when occupancy exceeded 97%. The management agent continued to charge the Project 5.25% when
occupancy increased to 97%.
Cause
Management agent's failure to abide by form HUD-9839-B that updated the 2010 management agreement
and capped the management fee at 5%.
Effect
The Project was overcharged for management fees since 2015.
Questioned Costs
Recalculating the management fee at 5% results in an overcharge to the Project of $1,572 for 2021, plus the
additional fees charged by the management agent and listed in finding 2021-001 under questioned costs.
Using the overcharge from 2021 of $1,572 times the past 6 years for 2016-2021 results in $9,432 in manage-
ment fee total questioned costs.
Recommendation
Review the management fee calculation monthly to ensure only the agreed upon amount is paid to the
management agent.
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions
We agree with the above finding. The new property management company's management agreement was
reviewed by legal counsel and contains the above required HUD provisions.",N,926339,1,,

Guidance) a deficiency in internal control over compliance exists when the design or operation of a control
over compliance does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned
functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal
program on a timely basis. A material weakness in internal control over compliance is a deficiency, or
combination of deficiencies, in internal control over compliance, such that there is a reasonable possibility
that material noncompliance with a type of compliance requirement of a federal program will not be prevented
or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.
Condition
Section 515 Rural Rental Housing loans for acquisition of Golden Eagle II Apartments in Tillamook, Oregon
were not recorded in NWCH's books, nor was the associated purchased asset. In addition, other state and
federal cost reimbursement grants that were not reimbursed by year-end were also unrecorded.
Context
The Section 515 Rural Rental Housing loan proceeds were wired directly to escrow at the closing of the
purchased property, as were state grants to purchase another property, resulting in the omission of
associated assets, debt, and grant revenue from the accounting system and financial reports produced from
the accounting system. Cost reimbursement grants not yet reimbursed were not recorded as grants
receivable and revenue. In addition, construction in progress costs of $37,054 were recorded as expenses.
Cause
The transactions discussed above did not go through NWCH's bank accounts and, accordingly, were not
recorded by the bookkeeper. Property purchase closing statements were received but were not recorded in
the books of accounts. Recording of construction in progress costs did not follow the capitalization policy.
Effect
Initial accounting records provided for the audit understated assets by $6,674,442, understated liabilities by
$3,037,712, understated revenue by $3,308,107, and understated the change in net assets by $3,640,875.
These are material omissions that are considered to be material weaknesses in internal control.
Questioned Costs
None.
Recommendation
Provide documentation for all financial transactions (grants, contracts, loans, closing documents, etc.) to
the bookkeeper for recording in the accounting system. Review accounting reports produced by the system
to make sure all assets, debt, grants, and other transactions are present and properly recorded.

33736,246905,2021,2021-001,"The auditee acknowledges the 88% compliance rate finding of the auditors and notes that no patient suffered financial harm, i.e., no patient was overcharged for services due to being assigned an inaccurate slide level in their electronic medical record (EMR). A review of the samples noted revealed that 9 individual patient accounts did not have a sliding fee application saved in the EMR when the patient was provided a sliding fee level. All instances noted were the result of front desk staff creating 30 day sliding fee plans for patients without the patient submitting a sliding fee application. Management would like to note that samples were selected from a date range prior to the implementation of the corrective action plan (CAP) associated with this finding from the prior year.
Management would also like to note that the individual responsible for ensuring the proper application of sliding fee procedures has been terminated for failure to follow the procedures. Implementation of routine audits caught the error and, therefore, the plan of action from the prior year will be continued.
Plan of Action:
Management reviewed the findings and rationalized the reasons these findings occurred as well as measures to reduce the potential for future errors. The following course of action has been completed:
¿ Only Financial Counselor staff create sliding fee plans in patient accounts
¿ All patient sliding fee eligibility documentation is saved in the patient EMR as well as any
associated household member accounts
¿ Continue to strengthen audit procedures. Based on the nature of the Sliding Fee Program, the documentation required to participate, and the setup of our Patient Management System (Athena), these performance audits are based on how accurately each employee enters information into the system and verify all required documentation is saved in the patient account:
Financial Counselor oversight – continue routine audits conducted by Financial Counselor
supervisor to ensure the accuracy of the sliding fee discounts given and required documentation within EMR Organizational oversight of the Sliding Fee Program – continue routine audits conducted by the Compliance Department to ensure the accuracy of the discount applied to patient accounts
¿ Continue with ongoing staff training to reiterate avoiding common mistakes while registering patients and working with patient information
¿ Develop electronic reporting to identify patients assigned a slide level without documentation attached to the account.
100% compliance with all regulatory requirements in all areas of the organization remains a top priority

demonstrate our ongoing commitment to providing our patients and the communities we serve high

Enrollment Reporting: Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance
1. The COVID-19 campus closure and subsequent changes to the academic calendar were unprecedented and created short-term disruption in administrative processes, which the University had in place. Due to the third-party processing issue, the University will be required to submit a third file for each reporting branch to our third-party processor. The University will
continue to compare the data submitted to our third-party processor and then forward to NSLDS, paying specific attention to those students who were affected by the original file processing issue. This additional process will identify all the files affected by this issue and ensure on-going accurate reporting.
2. For the delayed degree conferrals, the University has already implemented an escalation system for requests and reports run through our internal centralized email system. The University has also added additional reports sent regularly to our Associate Registrar responsible for enrollment reporting for additional supervision ensuring that the conferrals are processed in a timely manner. Additionally, the enrollment reporting team has developed training materials and procedure documentation to assist the training of new staff members with responsibility for enrollment reporting.

Material Weakness in Internal Control over Compliance and Material Noncompliance
Finding Summary:
The University may withdraw and spend up to 50 percent of the total aggregated endowment fund income earned prior to the date of expenditures. The University may not withdraw or spend the remaining 50 percent of the endowment fund income without Department of Education permission if 34 CFR 628.45(b) conditions are met. 34 CFR 628.45(c) requires repayment to the Department of Education of amounts spent in excess of 50 percent of the endowment fund income. The University spent more than 50 percent of the endowment fund income without explicit permission from the federal agency.
Responsible Individuals: Tami Lansing, Controller
Corrective Action Plan: The University received verbal approval from DOE in 2017 indicating that providing the fund was compliance at the end of 20 years, it was considered in compliance. At that time, the University lowered the yearly spending distribution from 5% to 3% to ensure meeting that requirement. This approval was not received in writing. Recent verbal communication from DOE has also indicated that we are currently in compliance, but they have communicated that it will not be issued in writing. To stay in compliance with issued regulations, the University will reimburse the fund $66,971 of funds that have been overdrawn over the past ten years, and will cease all future distributions until the twenty-year fund regulations are lifted.

Maher Duessel Finding: During our review of HUD-50058 Forms prepared by the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh (Authority) as part of the biennial reexamination process, we noted twelve forms that required corrections subsequent  to the original form being processed and/or did not have the required documentation to support the income calculation, due to a lack of functioning internal controls. In all cases of a required correction, the corrections resulted in changes to family income or in calculated rental/housing assistance payments and the corrections were not made in a timely manner. Of the twelve
HUD-50058 forms noted, six forms related to the MTW - Low Income Public Housing Program, and six forms
were related to the MTW - Housing Choice Voucher Program.


HACP Management Response:

Action Taken:  The HACP will continue to monitor and train staff regarding processes and procedures, to include and not limited to the HUD’s hierarchy of income verification.  It should be noted that many public agency systems shutdown due to the initial waive of COVID.  Many of the public agencies on which HACP participants rely to obtain required information continue to operate at a deficit.  The shut downs, along with the national great resignation snails the process of program participants’ ability to get documents required by HUD in time to complete certifications.   Income calculations are modified after the initial certification once HACP receives third party verification of the requested information.






HACP will continue the process of managerial and audits by the HACP Internal Compliance Department to reduce the necessity of corrections subsequent  to the initial submission.  Please note the process HACP will
follow is as follows:

Send notices regarding re-certifications 120 days in advance of the due date, Managers will review reports to assure timely submission of re-certifications
The Internal Compliance Department will review a sampling of files from the LIPH and the HCV
portfolio
Corrections will be made when discovered
Payment adjustments will be made to participant accounts when errors are discovered and corrected

(d) To foster greater economy and efficiency, and in accordance with efforts to promote cost-effective use of shared services across the Federal Government, the non-Federal entity is encouraged to enter into state and local intergovernmental agreements or inter-entity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of common or shared goods and services. Competition requirements will be met with documented procurement actions using strategic sourcing, shared services, and other similar procurement arrangements. 
(e) The Non-Federal entity must maintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement. These records will include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: Rationale for the method of procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection, and the basis for the contract price.
Condition/Context:	Based on our review of the Procurement compliance requirements, we noted that the Division did not have Witten procurement policies and competitive policies as required by CFR § 200.318 General procurement standards. We selected five vendors for procurement compliance  testing and we were not provided with written procurement policies and Procurement comparative policies, therefore, we were unable:

(1)	To verify that the procurement method used was appropriate based on the dollar amount and conditions specified in 2 CFR section 200.320.
(2)	To Verify that procurements provide full and open competition (2 CFR section 200.319 and 48 CFR section 52.244-5).
(3)	To examine documentation in support of the rationale to limit competition in those cases where competition was limited and ascertain if the limitation was justified  (2 CFR sections 200.319 and 200.320(f) and 48 CFR section 52.244-5).
Questioned Costs:	Cannot be determined

Recommendation:	We recommend that the Division must:

(1)	document procurement procedures, consistent with State, and local, laws and regulations and the standards, for the acquisition of property or services required under a federal award or subaward. 
(2)	The Division’s documented procurement procedures must conform to the procurement standards identified in §§ 200.317 through 200.327.

Corrective Action Plan:	The Division will work with Territorial Headquarters to document procedures as outlined in the Recommendations above.

Condition: During audit procedures, it was identified that time and effort
certifications for some employees were not available or were not completed
accurately.
Cause: The RSU does not have the necessary internal controls over compliance.
Effect: Salary costs in excess of work may be claimed, leading to questioned costs.
Identification of Questioned Costs: None identified.
Context: Out of a population of approximately 13, we tested 13 employees, of which
1 employee did not have any time and effort documentation for the Title I program.
Additionally, 3 of those 13 employees tested under Title I and were included in Title
I semi-annual certification as working 100% under Title I however, they also worked
under another funding source. Additionally, the time documentation was not clear as
to hours that were worked and expended to the Coronavirus Relief Fund.
Repeat Finding: This is a repeat finding.
Recommendation: It is recommended that the RSU implement procedures that cross
references employee listing by program to time and effort semiannual certification or
personal activity reports to ensure all employees under all programs have completed
time and effort documentation.
Current Process: RSU#13 had, until FY 2019-20, only utilized staff in federal
grant programs who spent 100% of their time doing allowable tasks making
Semi-Annual Certification the appropriate documentation for all federally
funded staff. We relied on our new digital time and attendance system,
purchased, in part, to track federal time to allow us to maintain compliance with
Personal Activity Reporting.
New Process: We will work with our vendors to ensure that our digital Time and
attendance system complies and allows the proper documentation of all time,
regardless of source of funds. With more staff being paid under multiple
objectives and/or multiple federal sources of revenue (and this likely being the
norm for at least the next 3 years) RSU#13 will ensure that our system is fully
functional and able to produce audit reports to satisfy federal requirements.
Personal Activity reports, when required, will be produced for federal grants at least monthly. Responsible Party: Grant Manager with support from Human Resources",N,923530,1,,
34100,232043,2021,2021-001,"Condition: During audit procedures, it was identified that the RSU did not have
employee contracts or documented wage basis for employees.
Cause: The RSU does not have the necessary internal controls over compliance.
Effect: The RSU is not utilizing contracts or wage agreements for all employees in
federal programs which result in documentation being adequately documented.
Identification of Questioned Costs: None identified.
Context: Out of a population of approximately 13, we tested 12 employees of which 3
employees did not have supporting documentation for Title I.
Repeat Finding: This is a repeat finding.
Recommendation: It is recommended that the RSU 13 implement internal control
processes and procedures to maintain contracts and/or wage basis documentation
for all employees.
Current Process: All staff have access to their terms and conditions of
employment either through access to online time and attendance reporting, a
document, or within the bargaining unit pay scales and track and step identified
on each paycheck. Terms and Conditions and contracts are issued for all new
staff and returning staff receive an annual Written Reasonable (hourly school
year staff) and professionals (Teacher’s contract) receive NOTIFICATION OF ANNUAL SALARY RATE. Calendar years staff receive contracts of between 1 and 5 years. Currently all wage and seniority information are kept digitally at a
minimum.
New Process: in a similar fashion where teachers receive a NOTIFICATION OF
ANNUAL SALARY RATE, we will incorporate annual wage and step information
(if applicable) to all staff, utilizing the Written Reasonable for school-year staff
and an annual notification for other staff. Copies will be maintained in personnel
files. Human Resources is in the midst of a complete review, and update, to all

Condition: The controls in place for reporting submissions did not identify that guidelines were
not followed related to the methodology used to report lost revenue.
Cause and Effect: Appropriate review of the reporting submissions was not completed to
ensure the reports followed required guidelines. As a result, the Corporation selected an
incorrect methodology option (option ii) for reporting lost revenues. Additionally, because the
Corporation used an incorrect option, they did not provide additional information to HHS
required under the correct option (option iii). The additional information included an explanation
for the reason the Corporation used option iii for reporting lost revenue. Planned Corrective Action: The Corporation's controls in place for reporting submissions did
not identify that Post-Payment Notice of Reporting Requirements guidelines were not followed

submission and the Period 1 and Period 2 reporting submissions for St. Joseph Elder Services

Condition: The Corporation did not follow the reporting requirements as outlined in the HHS
June 11, 2021 post-payment reporting notice. The Corporation's controls in place were not
adequate to prevent the entry of incorrect net patient service revenue (NPSR) annual and
quarterly totals for some of the Corporation's affiliates, as required by HHS.
Cause and Effect: The Corporation's procedures and controls did not prevent the entry of
inaccurate NPSR amounts from being entered into the HHS portal. As a result of the incorrect
information being entered, the Corporation has under reported the amount of lost revenue it has
incurred during the period of allowability for the Period 1 portal submission. Additionally, total
SPES NPSR for the calendar years noted in the context are not accurately stated. Planned Corrective Action: The Corporation will review the process surrounding NPSR entry
for portal submissions to ensure the appropriate levels of review and reconciliation are in place
to prevent this issue from recurring.
