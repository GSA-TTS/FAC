finding.
Explanation of disagreement with audit finding: Management concurs with the finding.
Actions planned in response to finding: In response to previous audit findings, the Office of
Records and Registration has already taken the following actions to ensure timely reporting:
• Continuous conversations between the Data Specialist, Registrar, and Associate
Registrars regarding enrollment data integrity and reporting requirements
• Using reporting tools to monitor and/or confirm student statuses
• Increased collaboration with the National Student Clearinghouse to create a reporting
schedule that ensures compliance
These actions were implemented during the 2019-2020 academic year, which resulted in a
documented decrease in the number of students whose statuses were not reported in a timely
fashion.
This specific finding was related to a software update that was not implemented by the Enterprise
Technology (ET) division in a timely manner. As a result, this student’s status change was
reported significantly late. Had the software been updated when it was released (prior to the Fall
2019 semester), we anticipate that this student’s enrollment status would have been reported on
time.
Responsible Party: Registrar
Planned completion date for corrective action plan: April 2021
Plan to monitor completion of corrective action plan: The office of Records and Registration
will continue to partner with Enterprise Technology to monitor software updates related to
reporting. The Registrar will monitor the weekly Ellucian “What’s New” updates to determine
whether a reporting-related update has been released, and will coordinate with ET to test and
implement accordingly. Additionally, the Data Analyst will be notified by the Registrar or Associate
Registrars when a reporting-related update is expected.",N,876374,1,,

In early January 2021, Jim Golembeski retired following 29 years as Bay Area WDB’s Executive Director and was succeeded by Matt Valiquette who for the previous nine years serviced as Bay Area WDB’s Program Operations Manager.  The new Executive Director along with the new Bay Area WDB Board of Directors Chairman, Charles Dallas, immediately began executing a previously developed “First 100 Days” plan which focused on assessing and evaluating four primary functional areas: 1) Governance relationships and structure; 2.) WDB Staff and Organization; 3.) Programs and Operations; and 4.) Fiscal/Technology.
Some of the early and obvious identified needs for improvement and enhancement centered on talent acquisition, monitoring/compliance, utilization of technology, and organizational strategic planning.  Consequently, the Bay Area WDB recruited and hired a highly experience data and policy analyst whose primary responsibilities focus on WIOA compliance through robust and comprehensive local program and service delivery monitoring.  The Bay Area WDB is also in the final states of recruiting an Accounting Assistant to aid in fiscal monitoring as well as preparing to potentially succeed the current controller Deb Spevacek, who may consider retiring from the workforce in the coming years.
The in-process development of a Comprehensive Local Monitoring Policy was also identified as an immediate need to better coordinate and prioritize sub-recipient monitoring requirements.  Following careful review, the Bay Area WDB is currently revising and preparing for Board of Director discussion and formal approval a comprehensive local monitoring policy adapted from a fellow WDB that has been previously cited as a positive practice.  Pending official Board of Directors approval, it is anticipated the policy will be fully implemented prior to the commencement of Program Year 2020 (July 1, 2021).

Grant Period – Year ended August 31, 2020
Compliance Requirement: Special Tests and Provisions
Criteria: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102) (GLBA) requires financial institutions to explain their information sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data.  The Federal Trade Commission considers institutions that participate in Title IV Educational Assistance to be financial institutions and subject to GLBA. This finding is based on the requirements for educational institutions participating in the federal awards and education loan program to meet the Federal Trade Commission’s GLBA Safeguards Rule (Title 16, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 314).
Condition and Effect: The College has performed a high-level assessment for a number of common information security controls. However, the assessment lacks the expected risk assessment framework and scoring of risk likelihood and impact for all in scope systems, vendors, and data sets.
Cause: The expected documentation supporting the required controls to adequately confirm compliance with GLBA safeguards was not complete.
Effect: Without demonstrable, documented controls supporting compliance with the GLBA
standards for safeguarding the protected data, compliance with the law and the requirements in the
federal PPA may not be assured.
Context: Inquiry and observation of the information received from the College related to compliance with GLBA.
Recommendation: The College should review the GLBA safeguarding rules and as soon as practical implement and document the controls necessary for compliance with the rule, focusing on the completion of a documented, thorough, and standardized risk assessment and management reporting framework. The College should perform comprehensive risk assessments on a regular basis, which is suggested to be at least annually, and at any significant change in infrastructure or business process.

Finding 2020-001: Eligibility Determination and Documentation

Condition:
The Authority failed to obtain, verify, and/or maintain required documentation to indicate participants’ eligibility under the Housing Choice Voucher Program (HCV) in tenants’ files as required under CFR Title 24: Housing and Urban Development. 

Plan:
The Authority has created two positions – Compliance Analyst (CA) - for quality control and training for the HCV Program. One position was filled on September 18, 2017 and the other was filled on November 12, 2018, when the HACC decided it needed more resources for auditing and training. The CA’s primary responsibilities are audits of tenant files and training.  Since the position was created, the CAs have provided weekly trainings to staff on various topics and aspects of the HCV Program. After each training session, staff is required to complete a “test you r knowledge” quiz to determine if the content of the training was learned. Anyone who scores 70% or less has to retake the training and the quiz.  

The CAs have performed file audits on a random sample of all staff’s files, including the new hires. The HACC had a turnover of seven positions in the HCV department this past year, so more upfront training was done to ensure staff had the knowledge necessary to accurately perform the functions of the position. For the existing staff, more emphasis is placed on auditing files where staff has issues with inadequate documentation or incorrect calculations. The CAs review the results of the audits with management and discuss the errors with the staff responsible for the file. Progressive discipline of staff who fails to maintain or correctly process eligibility certifications, annual recertifications, and moves to new units will be implemented as part of the corrective action plan. Checklists will continue to be used. Supervisors will conduct random reviews on the files processed by staff each month.

Finding 2020-002: Selection from the Wait List

Condition:
The Authority failed to obtain, verify, and/or maintain required documentation to indicate compliance with procedures to select new admissions from the wait list as required under CFR Title 24: Housing and Urban Development. 

Plan:
The Program Manager for the team responsible for processing new admissions will review 100% of the new admission files for staff who have been employed by the HACC for 12 months or less. Any deficiencies will be reviewed with staff and additional training will be provided to ensure they fully understand the requirements in processing new admissions. 

For staff who are responsible for processing new admissions and who have been employed with the HACC for over 12 months, at least 50% of the new admission files will be reviewed for accuracy and appropriate documentation. Any deficiencies will be reviewed with the staff and additional training will be provided as necessary. 

The Authority has hired two Compliance Analyst (CA) positions for quality control and training for the HCV Program. The CAs will assist with the file reviews described above as necessary. New hires will complete an extensive training program before they are assigned a caseload. 

The results of the file audits conducted by the CAs will be discussed with management. Progressive discipline of staff who fails to maintain adequate documentation or correctly process new admissions will be implemented as part of the corrective action plan. Checklists will continue to be used.

Condition:  The Organization’s surplus cash calculations from 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 indicate balances in excess totaling $33,506, which were not remitted to HUD account within the specified time frame.

Cause:  The Organization has not remitted balances in excess because their HUD representative has not requested them to do so. 

Effect:  The Organization’s surplus cash calculations from 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 indicate balances in excess totaling $33,506, which were not remitted to HUD within the specified time frame.

Corrective Action Plan: Management will contact HUD to coordinate remediation efforts and will implement procedures to ensure that future surplus cash is deposited into the Residual Receipts Reserve within 90 days of the Organization’s year end.

35545,247554,2020,2020-003,"Finding 2020-03:  Late Filing of Reports (Noncomplaince).

Criteria:  The Organization is subject to various reporting requirements with deadlines established by respective agencies.  Significant requirements include submitting a single audit to the federal government’s Office of Management and Budget, submitting an audit to the Utah State Auditor’s Office, submitting annual financial information and certifications through the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Financial Assessment Subsystem, filing a Form 990 with the federal government’s Internal Revenue Service, and filing quarterly 941s with the Internal Revenue Service.

Condition:  The Organization did not timely file significant reports.  Late reports included reporting for the Utah State Auditor’s Office (2019 and 2020), financial information and certifications for HUD (2018, 2019, and 2020), and Internal Revenue Service forms 941 (2020, two quarters).

Cause:  The Organization has not adequately assigned implementation and monitoring responsibilities for planning, preparing for, and meeting its reporting obligations.  

Effect:  The Organization’s reports with multiple agencies have been submitted late and could result in future restrictions or limitations.

Repeat Finding:  2017-5, 2018-5, 2019-3

Recommendation:  Management must assign responsibility for implementation and monitoring to appropriate and competent individuals.  The Organization should invest additional time and resources in personnel and processes to ensure that significant reporting requirements are met on a timely basis. 

Corrective Action Plan:   Management agrees with the finding.  Management will assign responsibility for implementation and monitoring of important reporting to appropriate and competent individuals.  They will invest time and resources to ensure that significant reporting requirements are understood and met on a timely basis.

35546,247554,2020,2020-002,"Finding 2020-02:  Untimely Tenant Income Certifications (Noncompliance, Material Weakness)

Criteria:  The Housing Investment Partnership Program contracts require that tenant certifications be performed in accordance with 24 CFR 92.203(a)(1)(i) and 92.203.  These standards require an initial certification upon inception of the lease and subsequent annual recertifications.

Condition:  The Organization did not obtain tenant income certifications or recertifications on a timely basis as defined by 24 CFR 92.203(a)(1)(i) and 92.203.  

Cause:  The Organization has not assigned responsibility for implementation and monitoring of these responsibilities to appropriate and competent individuals.  

Effect:  The Organization did not timely obtain tenant income certifications for three of the nine tenants sampled.  Tenant income certifications had been obtained for these three tenants, but they were not obtained or renewed on the annual basis required by the standards.

Recommendation:  Management should assign responsibility for the implementation and monitoring of tenant income certifications to appropriate and competent individuals to ensure they are performed in accordance with 24 CFR 92.203(a)(1)(i) and 92.203.

Corrective Action Plan: Management agrees with the finding and will develop improved revenue recognition policies related to contribution revenue.  Management will assign responsibility for implementation and monitoring of revenue recognition policies to appropriate and competent individuals.

35547,247554,2020,2020-001,"Finding 2020-01:  Inadequate Evidence to Support Segregation of Authorization and Recording Duties over Cash Disbursements (Significant Deficiency).

Criteria:  Internal controls over cash disbursements should ensure that cash is disbursed only upon proper authorization for valid organizational purposes, and that all disbursements are properly recorded.  One of the most important internal controls to help provide reasonable assurance that this will be accomplished is segregating authorization and recording duties.  The organization has an informal policy to require two signatures on all checks, one of which is different from the individual recording the transaction.  

Condition:  The Organization does not have consistent documentation to demonstrate that segregation of authorization and recording duties is occurring for each transaction. 

Cause:  The Organization’s monitoring over the implementation of the cash disbursements policy is not being adequately performed.

Effect:  The organization’s procedures increase the risk that cash may be disbursed for inappropriate organizational purposes.

Repeat of Prior Year Finding:  2017-1, 2018-1, 2019-1

Recommendation:  Management should ensure that the Organization’s cash disbursements policy is written with adequate detail so responsible individuals are identified to implement and monitor the policy.   The Organization must take action to ensure that segregation of duties over authorization and recording is occurring and can be supported by documentary evidence.

Corrective Action Plan:   The Organization agrees with the finding and will review its cash disbursements policy to ensure that responsibility for implementation and monitoring of the policy is assigned.

46009,255965,2020,2020-002,"Recommendation: Management should develop a system that ensures that any cash received from federal grantors is used within thirty days of receipt.

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions:  The USDA grant money was drawn down to an escrow account at a law firm.  Each purchase order was then sent to USDA grant representative. The grant representative  then would message the law firm to cut the checks for the items.  We received the grant prior to covid shutdown in North Carolina.   We then had delays with supply chain and getting invoices and deliveries from suppliers due to the first three months of the covid pandemic and construction delays associated with the pandemic. Those challenges led to the construction being delayed by 4 months and scheduling the receipt of the products.
