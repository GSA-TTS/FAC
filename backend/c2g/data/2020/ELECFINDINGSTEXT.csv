Federal Agency: Department of Education
Federal Program Title: Student Financial Assistance Cluster
CFDA Number:
84.268 – Federal Direct Student Loans
Award Period: July 1, 2019 – June 30, 2020
Compliance Requirement: Special Tests and Provisions
Type of Finding:
• Significant Deficiency in Internal Control over Compliance, Other Matters
Criteria or specific requirement: All schools participating (or approved to participate) in the
Federal Student Aid programs must have an arrangement to report student enrollment data to the
NSLDS through a Roster file (formerly called the Student Status Confirmation Report or SSCR).
The School is required to report changes in the student’s enrollment status, the effective date of
the status and an anticipated completion date. Changes in enrollment to less than half-time,
graduated, or withdrawn status must be reported within 30 days. However, if a Roster file is
expected within 60 days, you may provide the data on that Roster file (34CFR section 682.610).
Condition: The College did not report enrollment changes within the required 60 day timeframe
for one student in the sample tested.
Questioned costs: None.
Context: For 1 of 60 status changes tested, the student's enrollment statuses were not reported
timely.                                                                                                                     
Cause: The College’s processes and controls did not ensure that student status changes were
timely reported to NSLDS.
Effect: The NSLDS system is not updated with the student information in a timely manner which
can cause over awarding and the students may not properly enter the repayment period.
Repeat Finding: Yes, reported as 2015-01, 2016-002, 2017-004, 2018-003, and 2019-003.
Recommendation: We recommend the College review its reporting procedures to ensure that

Pass-Through Entity: Indiana Department of Education

Audit Finding: Material Weakness
Condition and Context
An effective internal control system was not in place at the School Corporation to ensure compliance
with requirements related to the grant agreement and the Eligibility; Matching, Level of Effort,
Earmarking; and Reporting compliance requirements.
Eligibility
The School Corporation utilized computer software to determine eligibility. The Food Service
Director/Coordinator was responsible for verifying the computer software made the correct
determination by reviewing every fifth application verified by the computer software. There was
no evidence of this review to ensure the eligibility determinations made by the software system
were accurate.
There was no evidence of internal control over the October Real Time Report. The Information
Technology (IT) employee uploaded the Real Time Report into the STN website. Any discrepancies
found were communicated to the appropriate building secretary or registrar to verify
enrollment and resolve conflicts. However, the IT employee was unable to provide adequate
documentation of communication with the building secretaries or registrars to support the
resolution on the enrollment errors made by the IT employee during the audit period.
The Title I Grant Coordinator entered the nonpublic information into the Title I application
manually. There was no evidence of review or oversight to ensure that the information entered
was accurate.
Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking and Reporting
The financial information submitted by the School Corporation to the Indiana Department of
Education through the Form 9 reports was used to calculate the School Corporation's level of
effort, as well as complete the State Per Pupil Expenditure Report.
The Payroll Clerk ran payroll in Skyward and verified the Summary Report after payroll was
prepared. There was no oversight or review process in place over payroll at the School
Corporation level to ensure the data used to complete the Form 9 was reported accurately in
the correct fund, account, and object code.
The Title I Grant Coordinator included the methodology from the budget process into the Title
I application to ensure the School Corporation was not supplanting. There was no oversight or
review process to ensure the methodology was properly implemented.
The lack of internal controls was a systemic issue throughout the audit period.
Criteria

Internal Control in the Federal Government' issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States or the 'Internal Control Integrated Framework', issued by the Committee of

Cause
Management had not developed a system of internal controls that would have ensured compliance
with requirements related to the grant agreement and the Eligibility; Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking;

Effect
The failure to design and implement a system of internal controls placed the School Corporation at

Repeat Finding
This is a repeat finding from the immediately prior audit report. The prior audit finding number was
2018-013.
Condition and Context
An effective internal control system was not in place at the School Corporation and at the South
LaPorte County Special Education Cooperative (Cooperative) to ensure compliance with the grant agreement
and the earmarking requirements of the Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking compliance requirement.
The Cooperative was a planning district whose purpose was to provide free appropriate public
education to students identified as disabled in accordance with state statute who were legal residents and/or
have been accepted through means of open enrollment, or other legal means of transfer to the participating
member school corporations in LaPorte County. The School Corporation was the administrator of this
Cooperative.
The School Corporation and the Cooperative did not maintain adequate supporting documentation
used to calculate the amount of special education and related services that were provided to students in
nonpublic schools and facilities for grants 18611-055-PN01 and 18619-055-PN01. Additionally, adequate
supporting documentation was not maintained for the second quarter of the 19611-055-PN01 grant. Since
we could not determine if the transactions were properly classified as nonpublic school expenditures, we
were unable to determine compliance with the earmarking requirements.

""The non-Federal entity must:
(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides
reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in

who are enrolled by their parents in nonpublic schools within its boundaries, is to the total
number of students with disabilities of the same age range.""
Cause
The School Corporation had not established a system of internal controls to ensure compliance
with the grant agreement and the earmarking requirement of the Matching, Level of Effort, Earmarking
compliance requirement.
Effect
The failure to maintain and provide appropriate supporting documentation prevented the determination
of the School Corporation's compliance with the earmarking requirements of the Matching, Level
of Effort, Earmarking compliance requirement.
Questioned Costs
There were no questioned costs identified.

We recommended that the School Corporation's management establish a system of internal controls

Federal Program

CFDA 16.575 – Victims of Crime Act Formula Grant Program, U.S. Department of Justice, passed-through from the Texas Office of the Governor, Criminal Justice Division
	
Criteria

Uniform Guidance and requirements established by the pass-through grantor states that charges to Federal awards for salaries and wages must be based on records that accurately reflect the work performed. These records must support the distribution of the employee's salary or wages among specific activities or cost objectives if the employee works on more than one Federal award; a Federal award and non-Federal award; an indirect cost activity and a direct cost activity; two or more indirect activities which are allocated using different allocation bases; or an unallowable activity and a direct or indirect cost activity. Employees working solely (100% of their time) on a single grant may periodically certify that the employee worked solely on that grant project. In addition to the periodic certifications, nonexempt employees must also maintain time sheets indicating the total number of hours worked each day.

Condition and Context

In a sample of 30 payroll transactions charged to the major federal program, we noted the following:
• One employee’s salary was charged to the federal program, but no supporting time sheet or certification was obtained. The amount of this federal expenditure was $3,548. 
• One employee who worked less than 100% on the federal award was charged to the federal program based on a certification-approach rather than the exact rate determined from the time sheet. Had the correct amount been charged to the federal program, the difference would have been less than $22. 
• Four time sheets signed by the employees were intended to certify that the employees worked 100% on the federal program for a given month. However, the time was entered on these time sheets indicated less than 100% of the employees’ time was related to the grant. We determined these were errors in completing the time sheets rather than errors in amounts charged to the federal award. 
• Two time sheets had formula errors in sub-total line items, although the final totals used to calculate amounts related to federal awards were clerically accurate.
These instances indicate internal controls over compliance related to time sheets is not functioning in a manner that would ensure noncompliance would be detected and corrected in a timely manner.

Cause

Time sheets are not obtained and reviewed in sufficient detail prior to requesting reimbursement from the federal program.
 
Questioned Costs:  Known and likely questioned costs were less than $25,000.

Effect

The transactions referenced above resulted in approximately $3,600 charged to the federal program with insufficient documentation.


Recommendation

We recommend that management ensure time sheets are obtained, reviewed, and approved prior to related amounts being requested for reimbursement from federal or state programs. The review control should consider whether requirements as described above have been met. ",N,895654,1,,

Criteria:  The organization must have internal controls in place to provide reasonable assurance that all the re-quired reports are submitted in a timely manner, are supported by underlying accounting and/or performance rec-ords, and are fairly presented in accordance with program requirements.

Condition:  During our audit, we noted that certain financial reports submitted to a funding agency had not been reviewed by someone independent of the preparer.  In addition, three of the submitted reports contained financial information on expenditures that did not agree to the underlying accounting records.   All quarterly reports filed during the year under audit were selected for testing.

Cause:  Internal controls are not designed and implemented to ensure that all required reports are submitted time-ly and with correct information.  In addition, no one independent of the preparer reviewed the reports for accura-cy.  

Effect: Missed filings of required reports and incorrect information reported to the federal agency prevented prop-er oversight by the funding agency and an underreporting of expenditures totalling $11,181.

Unallowable Costs:  None.

Audit Recommendation:  We recommend that management implement procedures to ensure all required reports are submitted properly and in a timely manner, and strengthen the organization’s review procedures related to the preparation of its Financial Reports.  At a minimum, someone independent of the preparer should review the re-ports and reconcile the data reported to that in underlying accounting records, to ensure that the information re-ported is complete and accurate.  

Management’s Response:  Management agrees with our auditors’ comments.  Management has begun to implement procedures to ensure that all required Financial Reports submitted by our Program Team will be submitted on time.  Before the report submission, the Program Team must obtain the Fiscal Team to review and approve these reports.

Uniform Guidance allowable costs standards.
Questioned Costs – None. Our testing did not indicate any instances of noncompliance.
Context – Three employee salary costs tested in Supporting Effective Instruction State

Audit Findings: Material Weakness, Modified Opinion
Condition and Context
An effective internal control system was not in place at the School Corporation to ensure compliance
with requirements related to the grant agreement and the Program Income compliance requirement.
The School Corporation did not utilize a separate fund to account for Prepaid Account Balances.
There was no distinction between prepaid amounts and program income. The comingling of funds prevented
the ability to determine the School Corporation's compliance with the program income requirements.
The lack of internal controls and noncompliance were a systemic issue throughout the audit period.
Criteria

""The non-Federal entity must:

(a) Establish and maintain effective internal control over the Federal award that provides
reasonable assurance that the non-Federal entity is managing the Federal award in
compliance with Federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the Federal
award. These internal controls should be in compliance with guidance in 'Standards for
Internal Control in the Federal Government' issued by the Comptroller General of the
United States or the 'Internal Control Integrated Framework', issued by the Committee of

Authority shall, with respect to participating schools under its jurisdiction: . . .
(12) Maintain a financial management system as prescribed by the State agency, or
FNSRO where applicable; . . .""
7 CFR 210.14(c) states:
""Financial assurances. The school food authority shall meet the requirements of the State
agency for compliance with § 210.19(a) including any separation of records of nonprofit school
food service from records of any other food service which may be operated by the school food
authority as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.""
7 CFR 210.14(f)(3) states: ""All revenue from the sale of nonprogram foods shall accrue to the
nonprofit school food service account of a participating school food authority.""
Cause
Management had not developed a system of internal controls that would have ensured compliance
with the grant agreement and the Program Income compliance requirement.
Effect
The failure to establish an effective internal control system enabled material noncompliance to go
undetected. Noncompliance with the grant agreement and the compliance requirement could have resulted
in the loss of federal funds to the School Corporation.
Questioned Costs
There were no questioned costs identified.
Recommendation
We recommended that the School Corporation's management establish a system of internal
controls to ensure compliance and comply with the grant agreement and the Program Income compliance
requirement.

Criteria or Specific Requirement (Including Statutory, Regulatory or Other Citation): Period of Performance: Where a funding period is specified, a recipient may charge to the grant only allowable costs resulting from obligations incurred during the funding period and any pre-award costs authorized by the Federal awarding agency. Unless the Federal awarding agency authorizes an extension, a recipient shall liquidate all obligations incurred under the award not later than 90 calendar days after the funding period or the date of completion as specified in the terms and conditions of the award or in agency implementing instructions. (2 CFR sections 215.28 and 215.71).

Condition: During the year ended June 30, 2020, the Foundation, in conjunction with the University of South Carolina (the “University” and the Foundation’s sole subrecipient), conducted an internal review of certain federal program expenditures. As a result of this internal review, it was determined that certain federal program expenditures of the Foundation were not properly closed out prior to the end of the respective programs’ periods of performance.  Therefore, the Foundation was not in compliance with the required period of performance requirements for certain federal programs.

Cause: Administrative internal control oversight with respect to period of performance requirements.

Effect or Potential Effect: The Foundation was not in compliance with the period of performance compliance requirements.

Questioned Costs: None.

Context: For 4 of 50 expenditures selected for testing, the Foundation did not properly record the expenditure within the period of performance.

Identification as a Repeat Finding: This is a repeat finding of prior year finding 2019-001.

Recommendation: We recommend that the Foundation enhance its internal controls to appropriately recognize expenditures within the period of performance.

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions: Foundation management and senior accounting in charge of processing invoices have met with subrecipient controller’s office to assess improvement in timing of receipt of invoices to the Foundation.  A single point of contact has been established with subrecipient to ensure timely receipt of all monthly evidence of federal program expenditures in the form of invoices or otherwise agreed upon by both parties.  Monthly, Foundation receives an accounts receivable report from the subrecipient to agree to Foundation General Ledger. And at year end, the Foundation reconciles every program’s federal awards expenditures, cumulative and annual, to the subrecipient’s records.

Condition
The School was unable to provide documentation to support enrollment, transfers out of the School,
and poverty-level data for some students selected for testing from the October 1, 2018 Real Time Data
report submitted to the State of Indiana. This report is used as part of the application for Title I funds.
Data for enrollment and poverty-level are used to assess eligibility of students for Title I funds. Data
on transfers provides information on students removed from the regularly adjusted cohort.
Criteria
2 CFR part 200.334 requires that “Financial records, supporting documents, statistical records, and all
other non-Federal entity records pertinent to a Federal award must be retained for a period of three years
from the date of submission of the final expenditure report or, for Federal awards that are renewed
quarterly or annually, from the date of the submission of the quarterly or annual financial report,
respectively, as reported to the Federal awarding agency or pass-through entity in the case of a
subrecipient.”
Cause
The School did not properly maintain documentation.
Effect
Compliance with eligibility and special tests and provisions requirements from the Compliance
Supplement could not be verified.

per student or the aggregate expenditures of the LEA from state and local funds for free public education
for the preceding year was not less than 90 percent of the combined fiscal effort or aggregate
expenditures for the second preceding year, unless specifically waived”.
Cause
The School did not properly exclude non-cash transactions from the trial balance accounts from
reporting on the Form 9.
Effect

Criteria:

A strong system of internal controls requires the Project to prepare its own financial statements and accompanying disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Condition:
As part of the audit, adjustments were made to properly record fixed asset additions and depreciation. 

The Project also engages Gordon, Stockman & Waugh, P.C. to assist in preparing its financial statements and accompanying disclosures.  However, as independent auditors, Gordon, Stockman & Waugh, P.C. cannot be considered part of The Project’s internal control system.

Cause:

The Project engages Gordon, Stockman & Waugh, P.C. to assist in this process as correction of this condition by the Project would require the employment of additional personnel.  Consequently, corrective action may not be practical.

Effect:

This increases the risk of material omissions or other errors in financial statements and accompanying disclosures.

Recommendation:

To establish proper internal control over the preparation of its financial statements, including disclosures, The Project should design and implement a comprehensive review procedure to ensure that the accounting records and financial statements, including disclosures, are complete and accurate.  Such review procedures should be performed by an individual possessing a thorough understanding of applicable generally accepted accounting principles and knowledge of The Project’s activities and operations.

Management Response:

This condition is inherent in operations which, for sound economic reasons, must function with a small number of office personnel.  Correction of this condition would require the employment of additional office personnel.

Criteria:

A proper segregation of duties is an important component of a system of strong internal controls and should be implemented, if possible.

Condition:

There is minimal segregation of duties among personnel involved in the accounting function.  A lack of proper segregation of duties could allow errors or irregularities to occur and go undetected.  Due to budgetary constraints imposed by HUD, small projects, for sound economic conditions, must function with a small number of office personnel and correction of this condition would require the employment of additional office personnel.  Consequently, corrective action may not be practical.

Cause:

For sound economic reasons, the Project and the management company must function with a small number of office personnel, and correction of this condition would require the employment of additional office personnel.  Consequently, corrective action may not be practical.

Effect:

A lack of segregation of duties increases the risk that errors or fraud may occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

Recommendation:

When this condition exists, management’s close supervision and review of accounting information is the best means of preventing or detecting errors and irregularities.

Condition and Criteria: 2 CFR 200.331 covers requirements for pass-through entities. 2 CFR 200.331(d) indicates pass-through entities must monitor the activities of the subrecipient as necessary to ensure that the subaward is used for authorized purposes in compliance with federal statutes, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the subaward and that subaward performance goals are achieved. The Organization has not compiled with these requirements.

Context: During our inquiries of management and review of the subrecipient agreements, we noted that the Organization did not comply with requirements for pass-through entities. Management performed monitoring of its subrecipients throughout the year but did not issue a formal written report of the monitoring performed and notify them of any findings and recommendations that need to be implemented.

Effect: This increases the risk of an unallowable expense being charged to a federal award or material noncompliance occurring by a subrecipient and going undetected by the Organization.

Cause: The organization did not have written policies and procedures in place. The was a lack of staff and the covid-19 pandemic all contributed to the lack of subrecipient monitoring.

Regulations require that an institution and a third-party service provider shall agree to comply with all requirements of 34 CFR 668.25(c) concerning compliance, liability, referrals, disbursements and returns, and repayments of Title IV funds.
34 CFR 668.25(c) states that in a contract with an institution, a third-party servicer shall agree to:
¿ Comply with all statutory or regulatory provisions, and special arrangements, agreements, limitations, suspensions, and terminations entered into under Title IV programs;
¿ Refer to the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Education for investigation any information indicating there is reasonable cause to believe that:

Cause:
The College did not have procedures in place to ensure that their contract with ECSI included the language required by 34 CFR 668.25(c).
Effect:
ECSI’s contract with the College did not include the language required by 34 CFR 668.25(c) concerning compliance, liability, referrals, disbursements and returns, and repayments of Title IV funds. Any finding ECSI receives becomes a finding of the institution they service.
Repeat finding:
No.
Recommendation:
When contracting with an institution for performing or providing any relevant Title IV function, the servicer and/or any of its contractors, essentially “steps into the shoes” of the institution with respect to compliance with the requirements for institutional administration of the Title IV student assistance program activity. The institution must ensure that its contract with any third-party servicer contains the required elements outlined in the regulations at 34 CFR 668.25(c). This can be done through contract review and inquiry of the third-party servicer.

Coronavirus Relief Fund identified another source of aid they had received with a specific time period for the
expenses it reimbursed. The expenses for which this beneficiary applied to BendNEXT for reimbursement related
to a time period within the date range of the other aid identified. BendNEXT relied on a signed affidavit from the
beneficiary stating that the expense for which reimbursement was received from BendNEXT had not also been
reimbursed by another source of aid. However, BendNEXT did not make further inquiry or obtain further
information to ensure the expense had not been previously reimbursed by another source of aid.
EFFECT: Upon further inquiry as a result of the compliance audit, BendNEXT ascertained from the beneficiary that the
aid distributed by BendNEXT did not reimburse the same expense reimbursed by other aid received by the
beneficiary. However, failure to obtain additional information from beneficiaries in similar instances create a strong
possibility of noncompliance with federal grant requirements.

Criteria: The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Public Law 106-102) (GLBA) requires financial institutions to explain their information sharing practices to their customers and to safeguard sensitive data. The Federal Trade Commission considers institutions that participate in Title IV Educational Assistance to be financial institutions and subject to GLBA. This finding is based on the requirements for educational institutions participating in the federal awards and education loan program to meet the Federal Trade Commission’s GLBA Safeguards Rule (Title 16, Chapter I, Subchapter C, Part 314). 
Condition: The College has performed a high-level assessment for a number of common information security controls. However, the assessment lacks the expected risk assessment framework and scoring of risk likelihood and impact for all in scope systems, vendors, and data sets. 
Cause: The expected documentation supporting the required controls to adequately confirm compliance with GLBA safeguards was not complete. 
Effect: Without demonstrable, documented controls supporting compliance with the GLBA standards for safeguarding the protected data, compliance with the law and the requirements in the federal PPA may not be assured. 
Context: Inquiry and observation of the information received from the College related to compliance with GLBA. 
Auditor’s Recommendation: The College should review the GLBA safeguarding rules and as soon as practical implement and document the controls necessary for compliance with the rule, focusing on the completion of a documented, thorough, and standardized risk assessment and management reporting framework. The College should perform comprehensive risk assessments on a regular basis, which is suggested to be at least annually, and at any significant change in infrastructure or business process.

internal control over grant compliance, including a process for maintaining appropriate
documentation for grant support. The internal control should allow management or employees,
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions to be knowledgeable about the
grant terms and review for compliance with such terms. Further, supporting documentation and
evidence of the review of such documentation should be maintained.
Condition - The external auditors noted sufficient monitoring controls were not maintained
around each respective grant to meet sufficient review requirements and proper documentation.
Effect – The lack of controls around monitoring and reviewing grant expenditures, resulted in
the following errors for the respective grants:
a) Emergency Solutions Grant – COJ (CFDA #14.231) –
1. Expenditures were coded to the wrong general ledger account, which is coded by grant.
b) Emergency Solutions Grant- RAMP – MHC (CFDA #14.231) -
1. Expenditures were coded to the wrong general ledger account, which is coded by grant.
2. Support could not be provided for the payroll expenditures that were submitted as
federal expenses.
Cause – Lack of sufficient review controls over grant documentation and maintenance of such
documentation.
Recommendation – The organization should have a process in place to maintain proper
documentation for all federal grant activity and implement a periodic review to ensure that the
documentation exists and is appropriate. We believe that by creating a formal process with a
review element would allow the Organization to maintain appropriate documentation to support
all federal expenditures
Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Action – Stewpot Community Services,
Inc. will design a process to ensure that each grant expenditure is supported by appropriate
documentation and implement a review element to ensure that the documentation is reasonable
and accurate. The Executive Director will perform a secondary review to ensure all
requirements are met.",N,922010,1,,

Finding 2020-001: Eligibility Determination and Documentation
Federal Agency: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
CFDA 14.871 Section 8 Housing Choice Vouchers
Federal Award Numbers and Years (or Other Identifying Numbers): IL025
Requirement: Eligibility
Prior Year Finding Number: 2019-001

Criteria:
Under the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 24: Housing and Urban Development, the Authority (as a PHA) is required to obtain, verify, and/or maintain the documents listed below to document participants’ eligibility:
a.	Certification of Application/Renewal
b.	Certificate of Income
c.	General Authority of Release of Information
d.	Declaration of Citizenship or Eligible Immigration Status (such as birth certificate, social security card, etc.)

Condition:
The Authority failed to obtain, verify, and/or maintain required documentation to indicate participants’ eligibility under the Housing Choice Voucher program in tenants’ files as required under CFR Title 24: Housing and Urban Development.

Questioned Costs: None noted.

Context:
Out of a total sample size of 60 program participants, the following exceptions were noted:

•	In the Annual Reexamination of three program participants, executed HAP contract was not part of the active tenant file.
•	In the Annual Reexamination of four program participants, household vital records were not part of the active tenant file.
•	In the Annual Reexamination of one program participant, HAP Contract was not signed by both the Authority and Landlord. 

Effect:
Not maintaining appropriate documentation in the files limits the Authority’s ability to demonstrate compliance with eligibility requirements.

Cause:
Staff have caseloads of 600+ clients which may lead to errors in documentation and calculations. Supervisors review only one percent of staff files. Issues found are notated but all files do not get reviewed. The increase in utilization and the decrease in administrative fees hinders the Authority’s ability to review a higher percentage of the files.

Finding 2020-001: Eligibility Determination and Documentation (Continued)

Recommendation:
We recommend the Authority to provide refresher trainings to Housing Specialists on the basic eligibility criteria, to conduct training updates and implement eligibility processing standards of the program.

We also recommend the Authority to properly maintain supporting documents for every Annual and Interim Reexaminations in order to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the information collected on the Family Report (HUD-50058) submitted to HUD. Per Form HUD-50058 Instruction Booklet, the data collected on the form provided HUD with a picture of the people who participate in subsidized housing programs. Public Housing Agencies (PHAs) collect and electronically submit information contained on the Form HUD-50058 to HUD. The Public and Indian Housing Information Center (PIC) system then captures this information and creates reports used to:

•	analyze the subsidized housing programs
•	monitor PHAs
•	detect fraud, and
•	provide information to Congress and other interested parties

View of responsible officials:
Management concurs with the finding. See correction action plan for additional information.

Criteria:  Surplus cash, as calculated in the REAC report, must be deposited into the Residual Receipts Reserve and balances in excess of $250 per unit must be remitted to HUD within 90 days of the Organization’s year end.

Condition:  The Organization’s surplus cash calculations from 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 indicate balances in excess totaling $33,506, which were not remitted to HUD account within the specified time frame.

Cause:  The Organization has not remitted balances in excess because their HUD representative has not requested them to do so. 

Effect:  The Organization’s surplus cash calculations from 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 indicate balances in excess totaling $33,506, which were not remitted to HUD within the specified time frame.

Repeat Finding:  2017-6, 2018-6, 2019-4

Recommendation:  Management should implement procedures to ensure that surplus cash is deposited into the Residual Receipts Reserve and that balances in excess of $250 per unit are timely remitted to HUD.

35524,247554,2020,2020-001,"Finding 2020-01:  Inadequate Evidence to Support Segregation of Authorization and Recording Duties over Cash Disbursements (Significant Deficiency).

Criteria:  Internal controls over cash disbursements should ensure that cash is disbursed only upon proper authorization for valid organizational purposes, and that all disbursements are properly recorded.  One of the most important internal controls to help provide reasonable assurance that this will be accomplished is segregating authorization and recording duties.  The organization has an informal policy to require two signatures on all checks, one of which is different from the individual recording the transaction.  

Condition:  The Organization does not have consistent documentation to demonstrate that segregation of authorization and recording duties is occurring for each transaction. 

Cause:  The Organization’s monitoring over the implementation of the cash disbursements policy is not being adequately performed.

Effect:  The organization’s procedures increase the risk that cash may be disbursed for inappropriate organizational purposes.

Repeat of Prior Year Finding:  2017-1, 2018-1, 2019-1

Recommendation:  Management should ensure that the Organization’s cash disbursements policy is written with adequate detail so responsible individuals are identified to implement and monitor the policy.   The Organization must take action to ensure that segregation of duties over authorization and recording is occurring and can be supported by documentary evidence.

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions:   The Organization agrees with the finding and will review its cash disbursements policy to ensure that responsibility for implementation and monitoring of the policy is assigned.

Criteria:  The Housing Investment Partnership Program contracts require that tenant certifications be performed in accordance with 24 CFR 92.203(a)(1)(i) and 92.203.  These standards require an initial certification upon inception of the lease and subsequent annual recertifications.

Condition:  The Organization did not obtain tenant income certifications or recertifications on a timely basis as defined by 24 CFR 92.203(a)(1)(i) and 92.203.  

Cause:  The Organization has not assigned responsibility for implementation and monitoring of these responsibilities to appropriate and competent individuals.  

Effect:  The Organization did not timely obtain tenant income certifications for three of the nine tenants sampled.  Tenant income certifications had been obtained for these three tenants, but they were not obtained or renewed on the annual basis required by the standards.

Recommendation:  Management should assign responsibility for the implementation and monitoring of tenant income certifications to appropriate and competent individuals to ensure they are performed in accordance with 24 CFR 92.203(a)(1)(i) and 92.203.

35526,247554,2020,2020-003,"Finding 2020-03:  Late Filing of Reports (Noncompliance).

Criteria:  The Organization is subject to various reporting requirements with deadlines established by respective agencies.  Significant requirements include submitting a single audit to the federal government’s Office of Management and Budget, submitting an audit to the Utah State Auditor’s Office, submitting annual financial information and certifications through the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) Financial Assessment Subsystem, filing a Form 990 with the federal government’s Internal Revenue Service, and filing quarterly 941s with the Internal Revenue Service.

Condition:  The Organization did not timely file significant reports.  Late reports included reporting for the Utah State Auditor’s Office (2019 and 2020), financial information and certifications for HUD (2018, 2019, and 2020), and Internal Revenue Service forms 941 (2020, two quarters).

Cause:  The Organization has not adequately assigned implementation and monitoring responsibilities for planning, preparing for, and meeting its reporting obligations.  

Effect:  The Organization’s reports with multiple agencies have been submitted late and could result in future restrictions or limitations.

Repeat Finding:  2017-5, 2018-5, 2019-3

Recommendation:  Management must assign responsibility for implementation and monitoring to appropriate and competent individuals.  The Organization should invest additional time and resources in personnel and processes to ensure that significant reporting requirements are met on a timely basis. 

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions:   Management agrees with the finding.  Management will assign responsibility for implementation and monitoring of important reporting to appropriate and competent individuals.

46009,255965,2020,2020-002,"Condition:  In 2020, the Organization received a significant amount of money from the federal government that was not utilized within thirty days of receipt. Given the amount of time that the cash was held and the prevailing interest rates in 2020, the resulting gains by the Organization were not material as it relates to questioned costs; however, it is an issue as it relates to the Organization’s internal controls over cash management.

Criteria:  Internal controls should be in place to provide reasonable assurance that federal awards are used for their intended purposes without unnecessary delays.

Effect:  Failure to spend federal awards in a timely fashion could results in significant lost earnings by the federal government and the need for reimbursement by the Organization.

Recommendation: Management should develop a system that ensures that any cash received from federal grantors is used within thirty days of receipt.

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions:  The USDA grant money was drawn down to an escrow account at a law firm.  Each purchase order was then sent to USDA grant representative. The grant representative  then would message the law firm to cut the checks for the items.  We received the grant prior to covid shutdown in North Carolina.   We then had delays with supply chain and getting invoices and deliveries from suppliers due to the first three months of the covid pandemic and construction delays associated with the pandemic. Those challenges led to the construction being delayed by 4 months and scheduling the receipt of the products.
