1905,91751,2019,2019-002,"2019-002 The University awarded one student in excess of the annual loan limit for Subsidized
Direct Loans, based on that student's grade level.

Name of Contact Person
Paul Winker, Associate Director of Financial Aid is responsible for the corrective action that is
planned by Ian Freyberg, Director of Financial Aid with over 10 years' experience in the field.

Corrective Action Plan
Beginning with the start of the 2019-2020 academic year the University of the Cumberlands
moved to an integrated software system, Banner. Students enrollment and grade levels are
checked at time of packaging and again prior to disbursing aid. Banner enrollment module
(ROAENRL) is tied to Financial Aid (RPAAWRD) allowing the software to identify students with
award loan levels greater than attempted credit hours and grade levels. Prior, method of
awarding using external reports has been discontinued. Additionally, staff will continue to
receive both in-house and external training in financial aid practices, policies and procedures.
Most recently staff attended the NASFA New Aid Officers Workshop.

Anticipated Completion Date
The student that was noted during the 2019 audit was corrected upon detection. The overaward
was returned and the student was given a scholarship so they would not be affected by
the administrative error.

Name of Contact Person

Ian Freyberg, Director of Financial Aid and Chuck Du pier, Registrar are responsible for the
corrective action that was planned with the aid of William DeWolf,Ph.D. of FocusEDU. William
De Wolf has over 17 years' experience as a Registrar and is a member of the Banner
Implementation team. The status changes are reported by the Registrar (Chuck Dupier), who
administratively reports to the Vice President for Academic Affairs.

Corrective Action Plan
Beginning with the start of the 2019-2020 academic year the University of the Cumberlands
moved to an integrated enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system, Banner. Prior, the
University used separate, non-integrated platforms that required different methods to bridge
data and creating room for reporting deficiencies. To further ensure correct enrollment
reporting, Financial Aid and the Register have received training from Banner consultants with
expertise in registration and financial aid. The training focused on processes and the flow of
information between offices. As a measure of redundancy, financial aid will review students
that have withdrawn and been processed for Return of Title Four Funds (R2T4) with NSLDS
Enrollment Reporting. The Registrar will also be given access to make enrollment updates
through NSLDS. All updates to enrollment through NSLDS and/or National Student Clearing
House will be conducted by the Registrar unless express permission is given.

Anticipated Completion Date
All records with errors noted during the 2019 audit were corrected upon discovery. Records for
the 2019-2020 award year are currently under review for any discrepancies. Review will
continue throughout the current award year for students with changes in course load and
status of enrollment.

Corrective Action:  The lateness of the financial audit was caused by a number of factors being the retirement of two key management personnel in the Finance Department (director and deputy director), deficiency in succession planning, lack of sufficient staffing in the Finance department, insufficient delegation of duties, lack of cross training, and inadequate written procedures.  A contributing factor was also Hurricane Florence in September 2018, and Coronavirus Pandemic in March, 2020 to present which further strained finance personnel resources.  The issues were handled as follows:

Staffing - City management hired an experienced and credentialed professional to help bridge the gap between the retiring finance director.  The new director hired an experienced professional to serve as the deputy director.  Upon assessment of the financial accounting system, structure and processes, the director began implementing critical improvements to the system to ensure accountability and adherence to federal, state and local laws, policy and procedures.  Training and counseling continues to be an ongoing process with all City staff related to finance matters.  Director requested and was granted the use of contract professional accounting assistance to help with recreating and reconciling the fiscal 2018 books to determine the various errors and misstatements, and reconciling the 2019 records.  Director requested and was granted one full time position in fiscal year 2020, which was filled in fiscal year 2021.  Director requested four full time positions in fiscal year 2021 for the critical functions of purchasing and inventory, accounts receivable and accounts payable, and only 2 positions for purchasing and inventory were approved.  Director requested and was granted part-time staff to assist with providing backups to critical functions such as payroll and accounts payable in fiscal 2021, and these positions were filled mid-year fiscal 2021.  Director has requested part-time staff to assist with providing backups to the critical function of accounts receivable and records management in fiscal 2022, and the outcome of which is yet to be determined.

Delegation of duties - With the addition of personnel, it is possible now to have at least one backup for the critical functions of payroll, accounts payable, purchasing and inventory.  It is now possible for the director and deputy director to delegate those inherited tasks that are more suitable for subordinate staff.  With the addition of staffing it allows director and deputy director to provide direction and oversight, as well as cross train on duties so that there is sufficient coverage to meet critical deadlines.

Written procedures - Director has implemented written procedures to assist staff in performing their tasks to include proper review and approval of transactions. Director has required staff to provide sufficient data backup and authorization for all transactions entered into the City’s accounting system. 

Proposed Completion Date:  Due to the number of reconciling issues encountered, the above measures were taken from July 2019 through April 2021.  Staffing has not been completed for several of the part time positions, and will be necessary in order to correct the finding.  The audit for fiscal year 2020 was delayed due to resolving the issues with fiscal year 2018 and 2019 and has not been completed as of April 18, 2021.  Management expects to have the audit for fiscal year 2020 completed no later than October 1, 2021.

Recommendation: Our auditors recommended the Organization take measures to ensure that appropriate sliding fee rates/categories are used for each sliding fee encounter.
Explanation of disagreement with audit finding: There is no disagreement with the audit finding.
Action taken in response to finding: The Organization is aware of the importance of properly applying the sliding fee scale to all eligible patients. We feel that we have strong policies and procedures to ensure this is performed accurately. However, the process is dependent on many individuals and is susceptible to human error. We will implement two new processes to mitigate this risk.
1.	Enrollment specialists will enter a patient’s exact Federal Poverty Level (FPL) when enrolling patients in our electronic health record. By entering the exact FPL, Enrollment Specialists can compare the patient’s actual FPL rating against the plan FPL rating that is selected.
2.	The Organization will begin auditing sliding fee applications on a monthly basis. More frequent audits will ensure that application information is accurately entered into our electronic health record. We will require all eligibility workers to maintain an error rate less than 5%.  If error rate exceeds 5% we will re-train and increase audit frequency.

Management Comments and Corrective Action:  In a Notice of Monetary Disallowance dated July 2, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), Administration for Children and Families (“ACF”), presented findings noted through a review of leases and contracts executed by Southwest Key Programs, Inc. (“SWK”), during the periods of January 1, 2006 through March 31, 2019.  The findings were noted by PMB Helin Donovan, LLP (PMB) in the Southwest Key Programs, Inc. audit report dated February 11, 2020. 

In response to this Notice SWK paid the total disallowed amount of $5,057,927.68.  

Additionally, SWK gave written 60 days’ notice of termination, per lease agreement requirements, to the lessors on the above referenced leases on July 29, 2019.  SWK began working with the relevant funding agency to coordinate the relocation of the operational shelters from the facilities and vacated the properties effective September 27, 2019.  Furthermore, rent payments subsequent to the findings date (April – September 2019) were not charged to the federal award.  In addition, SWK Management put procedures in place to ensure lease agreements are free of conflicts of interest in appearance and fact, including expanding the required board and executive annual conflict of interest disclosures to include all employees. 

The less-than-arm’s length transactions with for-profit subsidiaries were discontinued during 2017 so no further action was required.  

Additionally, SWK hired a Procurement Manager to more fully develop the SWK Procurement function to ensure policies, procedures, and purchasing practices comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Code of Federal Regulations, commercial procurement policies and any other unique and applicable customer procurement requirements. 
Effective August 1, 2019, it is mandatory that the Procurement Manager, and any other designated employee authorized to procure goods/services on behalf of SWK, follow the procedures as set forth in the SWK Procurement Manual.   These responsibilities are summarized as follows:
•	Enforce adequate policies regarding the standards of business conduct both external and internal which are contained in the SWK Procurement Manual and Employee Guidebook. Employees involved in the procurement of goods and services shall make reasonable efforts to determine that SWK qualified vendors and contractors are not owned or controlled by SWK employees or relatives of SWK employees. 
•	Avoid any involvement in unethical, compromising positions and conflicts of interest; 
•	Use competitive sourcing procedures and ensure debarred or suspended contractors are properly excluded from contract award.

Management Comments and Corrective Action:  During the course of their audit of financial results for the year ended August 31, 2019 PMB, through sampling of the population of all procured services, noted an instance where SWK did not meet its own Procurement Policies requiring three quotes for procured services between $25,000-$100,000.  The instance of noncompliance noted was for a telephone service contract serving only four of its twenty-eight Unaccompanied Minor shelters and dated back to 2014.  

Given the accelerated timelines funding agencies generally ask SWK to operationalize facilities, at times in the past, telephone services for shelters were carried over using the carrier already servicing the respective buildings from previous tenants, therefore bypassing the process laid out by SWK’s Procurement Policy.  

As noted in response to Finding 2019-001 above SWK hired a Procurement Manager to more fully develop the SWK Procurement function to ensure policies, procedures, and purchasing practices comply with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, Code of Federal Regulations, commercial procurement policies and any other unique and applicable customer procurement requirements.  This will include stringent adherence guidelines that are tiered based on procurement levels.

Condition
The College incurred costs that do not meet the general criteria in order to be allowable under federal awards; the costs were not reasonable and were not of sound business practice.
.Management's Response

The college acknowledges some confusion around certain grant related expenditures. However, all expenditures whether grant funded or college funded go through an automated approval process, so expenditures were approved. There is sometimes ambiguity over allowed costs. When this occurs the college attempts to get clarification from the lending agency, we will continue to do so.
Corrective Action
The college will continue to monitor grants and grant related expenditures. We believe this was an isolated instance. Training will continue by Finance personnel on allowable and unallowable expenditures. The college has a board approved grant manual to address these questions.

Management's Response

The college acknowledges the issue surrounding this enrollment reporting condition. The procedures surrounding this process are being revamped, and we believe that students who have withdrawn or never attended will be correctly reported as such.

The College did not identify, in a timely manner, students who ceased academic attendance. As a result, a Return of Title IV Funds Calculation (""return calculation"") was not performed in a timely manner.

Management's Response

The college acknowledges the issue surrounding the return of Title IV funds in a timely manner. The college also recognizes the need for timely refunds of all financial aid monies when warranted and required by state, local or federal statute. The college further acknowledges this finding is a repeat of a prior year finding
During fiscal year 2018 the Financial Aid Director retired, there was a period where the position was vacant and as a result, certain tasks and verifications were not performed in a timely manner. A new Financial Aid Director was hired late in Fiscal Year 2018 and began to implement processes to ascertain all verifications were done properly. Since this hiring however, the position of Financial Aid Director has become vacant again. The college is in the process of hiring a new Director. This transition in Financial Aid directors has directly impacted the college's ability to return some Title IV funds in a timely manner
During calendar year 2019, a permanent, full-time Director of Financial Aid has been hired and is putting
in place steps to see that Title IV funds are returned properly and timely.
Corrective Action
The College will establish procedures to capture all students who cease academic attendance requiring a Return of Title IV Calculation to be performed in a timely manner. On-going training is also a priority and financial aid staff will be trained and/or re-trained accordingly in the rules ofTitle IV and return of funds.

The College did not recalculate Pell Grant Awards for students who never began attendance in one of their classes for that payment period. As a result, Pell Grant over-awards occurred.
Management's Response

The college acknowledges the over-award in the cases identified during the audit. The process of identifying changes in a student's enrollment status is somewhat manual. We believe this was a one­ time instance post 2018, as the financial aid team has been trained. The college further acknowledges this finding is a repeat of a prior year finding
In addition, through the use of technology and in particular blackboard, this reporting of students has become has become more automated and the college can track which faculty are and are not reporting this information.
The college continually works to achieve 100% participation in this important reporting requirement.
Corrective Action
The college will continue with our progress in this area, during the last reporting period we had 80% of all full-time faculty use blackboard to report attendance, this is a significant improvement over past periods. At the beginning of each academic year, the college's finance staff, specifically the Bursar, makes a presentation to full-time and adjunct faculty on the importance of reporting the students who have never attended, this will continue each and every semester.

Planned Corrective Action:
The University identified errors related to the return of Title IV funds calculations and has corrected each error within Banner, the University’s software product used in maintaining student information.  The errors were limited to students enrolled in online programs that operate on a different term calendar than standard semester programs.  Improvements were implemented as follows:  
•	To ensure programs outside of the standard two semester calendar terms reflect the correct enrollment start dates, end dates, and applicable break days, the University implemented a standard set of trimester and quarter calendars within Banner beginning Fall 2019.  
•	Student Financial Aid will complete the initial withdrawal within each program for each semester, trimester and quarter terms using the federal withdrawal calculator on FAA Access and in Banner.  These two independent calculations will then be compared in order to ensure return of Title IV funds calculations are accurate, timely, and in accordance with the U.S. Department of Education’s Federal Student Aid Handbook.

Dear Ms. Myers:

The findings and corrective actions for Hampton County School District 2 as a result of our fiscal year 2019 annual audit are as follows:

Finding 2019-001 – Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

Condition: Certain critical tasks that are a fundamental part of the District’s internal control over financial reporting were not performed.  Specifically, routine monthly balance sheet account reconciliations were not performed in a timely manner.

Cause of Condition: There are two key factors that lead to this finding: (1) the District encountered difficulty in reconciling certain accounts due to their inability to receive complete, accurate information from a third-party in a timely manner; and (2) the District faces an inherent time constraint, due to staff size, which requires the District's finance staff to prioritize key tasks based on their necessity.

District Response: Since year end, the District has made positive changes to remedy this finding.  The District has resolved communication issues with the County Treasurer to reconcile the Cash with County Treasurer account in a timely manner and have hired two qualified staff members in the finance department.  The District anticipates a continued open and frequent communication with the County Treasurer to ensure timely reconciliation and the District will provide proper training for the new staff members of the finance department.

Finding 2019-002 – Internal Controls over Financial Reporting

Condition: The District’s unadjusted financial statements reported material misstatements in certain financial statement accounts for the period under audit.  These misstatements were not prevented or detected by the District’s internal control over financial reporting and were not corrected by the District prior to the financial statements being presented for audit.

Cause of Condition: During the months subsequent to year-end, the District accrued the July 2019 invoice for construction services, instead of the June 2019 invoice, overstating accounts payable by $51,131 in Special Revenue Fund - EIA.  Per the Director of Finance, the June bill was misplaced, and it wasn't known that a June bill existed until after the July bill was already paid; the District accrued the July bill believing the bulk of the work was performed prior to June 30, 2019.

District Response: The District has taken steps to ensure that this isolated incident is not repeated.  Specifically, the finance department has added two additional staff members to help alleviate the work load of the new Director of Finance.  This will ensure the Director of Finance has enough time to properly account for all accruals at year end.

December 2, 2019


Finding 2019-003 – Reporting

Criteria and Condition: The District is required to report all expenditures during the reporting period that are supported by underlying accounting or performance records.  The required reporting, including both the budget and expenditure reporting, should accurately reflect the expenditures of the District for the reporting program and period.

Cause of Condition: The District's management did not follow proper procedures to verify all expenditures were properly recorded in the financial records and  claimed for reimbursement in the manner they were expended.

Client Response: The District has taken steps to ensure that this isolated incident is not repeated.  Specifically, the finance department has added two additional staff members to help alleviate the work load of the new Director of Finance.  This will ensure the Director of Finance has enough time to properly account for federal claims each quarter.

In each case, the Director of Finance will serve as the primary contact person for district compliance efforts related to these findings.

Please contact our office should you have any questions.


Yours very truly,

6379,184405,2019,2019-002,"Actions Taken: During fiscal year 2019 we have implemented and enhanced a proactive process to eliminate
uncollectable receivable balance. The first step in this process occurs with our billing process. When potential
services get submitted that are truly uncollectable, the billing team closes them out instead of billing them so no
uncollectible receivable gets generated. For billable services, which the vast majority or coming from
governmental sources (City, State, etc.) we get paid for the billings just sometime it can be delayed. The
remaining billed services from third party providers (insurance companies, etc.) generally pay based on our
contracted rates. There are some additional services or portions of services that fall under private pay that may
have a higher likelihood of being outstanding. Based on the above parameters we feel that the current recorded
bad debt reserve is adequate. We will continue to monitor the reconciliation and review process for accounts
receivable in order to continue to improve the accuracy of the estimated reserve for uncollectible accounts

Recommendation: CLA recommends the District perform a risk assessment of its operations to identify and implement mitigating controls to reduce the risk of errors or intentional fraud. The District should review its disbursement process to ensure that there is adequate segregation of duties in regards to initiating, authorizing and approving purchases, along with adding controls to ensure that the item purchased was received by the District. The District should review is payroll process and identify payroll tasks that could be reassigned to other District personnel. We also recommend the Board of Education continue to monitor the transactions and the financial records of the District.
Explanation of disagreement with audit finding: There is no disagreement with the audit finding.
Action planned/taken in response to finding: Management believes that the cost of segregating cash receipts and cash disbursement duties from the related recording functions outweigh the benefits to be received.
