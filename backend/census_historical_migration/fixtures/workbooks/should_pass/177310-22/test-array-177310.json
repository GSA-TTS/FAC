Molter Road\r\nLiberty Lake, WA 99019\r\n509-558-5437\r\nCorrective action the auditee plans to take in response to the finding:\r\nThe District agrees with the State Auditor\u2019s Office that we did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements as noted. The District used the same process as noted in this Finding in the prior audit which did not have any exceptions noted by the State Auditor\u2019s Office. Moving forward the District will ensure federal prevailing wage rate clauses are in contracts entered into using federal funds and that weekly certified payroll reports are collected from contractors and subcontractors.\r\nAnticipated date to complete the corrective action: August 2023",

In fiscal year 2022, the District expended a total of $22,519,443 of its ESF awards. This included $3,648,641 in the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER II) subprogram (84.425D), $18,850,563 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER/ESSER III) subprogram (84.425U), and $20,239 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief  Homeless Children and Youth (ARP HCY I & II) subprogram (84.425W).Federal regulations require recipients to establish and maintain internal controls that ensure compliance with program requirements. These controls include understanding grant requirements and monitoring the effectiveness of established controls.Under federal wage rate requirements, also known as the Davis-Bacon Act, contractors and subcontractors that work on projects financed with more than $2,000 of federal money must pay laborers and mechanics wage rates that the U.S. Department of Labor considers being similar to what local workers have been paid for similar projects.For construction contracts subject to these wage rate requirements, the District must include a provision that the contractor and subcontractor comply with those requirements and the Department of Labors regulations. This includes a requirement for the contractor and its subcontractor to submit to the District weekly, for each week in which any contract work is performed, certified payroll reports. These reports must include a copy of the payroll and a signed statement of compliance.The District may use a contracted project manager to collect certified payroll reports from contractors and subcontractors, but ultimately, it is the Districts responsibility to comply with these requirements and maintain documentation demonstrating compliance.Description of ConditionDuring the 2021-22 school year, the District spent $2,685,727 from its ESSER II award to pay two contractors and their subcontractors for installing and upgrading the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems at four school buildings and the District office. These projects were part of the Districts school facility capital improvement efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and enable school operations by facilitating greater air flow and filtration. During the audit period, the District awarded and entered into a contract with one of the contractors, and contracted with two project managers to supervise the projects, which included collecting weekly certified payroll reports from the contractors and subcontractors.Our audit found the District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements. Specifically, the District did not:Include the required prevailing wage rate clauses in the contract established with one contractorCollect, or ensure project managers collected, weekly certified payroll reports from the contractors and their subcontractors to confirm they paid laborers proper prevailing wagesWe consider these deficiencies in internal controls to be a material weakness, which led to material noncompliance.The issue was not reported as a finding in the prior audit.Cause of ConditionDistrict staff said they used a purchasing cooperative to procure the general contractor, and they relied on the contract between the purchasing cooperative and the general contractor, which included the required prevailing wage language. However, staff said they did not know the District was required to include this language in its own contract with the contractor.Additionally, the District relied on the project managers to verify the contractors and subcontractors submitted weekly certified payroll reports to the Washington State Labor and Industries (L&I) website. Although District staff said they checked that weekly certified payroll reports were uploaded to the L&I system before the District paid the contractors, this process was not documented. Further, District staff and project managers did not know the District needed to obtain all certified payroll reports each week.Effect of Condition Without adequate internal controls that ensure it includes the prevailing wage rate clauses in its contracts and collects all weekly certified payroll reports, the District cannot demonstrate it complied with federal wage rate requirements. The District could also be liable for paying any additional wages if the contractors and subcontractors did not pay prevailing wage rates to laborers working on the contracts.RecommendationWe recommend the District develop internal controls to ensure compliance with federal wage rate requirements. This should include inserting prevailing wage rate clauses into contracts, as well as implementing effective monitoring processes to collect and review all weekly certified payroll reports timely from contractors and subcontractors.Districts ResponseThe District agrees with the State Auditors Office that we did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements as noted. The District used the same process as noted in this Finding in the prior audit which did not have any exceptions noted by the State Auditors Office. Moving forward the District will ensure federal prevailing wage rate clauses are in contracts entered into using federal funds and that weekly certified payroll reports are collected from contractors and subcontractors.Auditors RemarksWe appreciate the Districts commitment to resolve this finding and thank the District for its cooperation and assistance during the audit. We will review the status of the Districts corrective action during our next audit.Applicable Laws and RegulationsTitle 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), section 516, Audit findings, establishes reporting requirements for audit findings.Title 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Guidance, section 303, Internal controls, describes the requirements for auditees to maintain internal controls over federal programs and comply with federal program requirements.The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants defines significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in its Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, section 935, Compliance Audits, paragraph 11.Title 29 CFR, Section 3.3  Weekly statement with respect to payment of wages, and Section 3.4  Submission of weekly statements and the preservation and inspection of weekly payroll records, establishes requirements for contractor or subcontractor submission of weekly certified payroll reports.Title 29 CFR, Section 5.5  Contract provisions and related matters establishes the requirements for the contracting officer to insert in full any contract in excess of $2,000 which is entered into for the actual construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of a public building or public work, or building or work financed in whole or in part with federal funds the clauses listed, which includes but is not limited to the minimum wages to be paid and payrolls and basic records to be maintained (submission of weekly certified payrolls)",
