                    "SCHEDULE OF FEDERAL AWARD FINDINGS AND QUESTIONED COSTS\nCentral Valley School District No. 356\nSeptember 1, 2021 through August 31, 2022\n2022-001\tThe District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with wage rate requirements.\nAssistance Listing Number and Title:\t84.425, COVID-19 Education Stabilization Fund\nFederal Grantor Name:\tU.S. Department of Education\nFederal Award/Contract Number:\tN/A\nPass-through Entity Name:\tOffice of Superintendent of Public Instruction \nPass-through Award/Contract Number:\tCOVID-19, 84.845U-0712260\nCOVID-19, 84.425D-0120411 \nCOVID-19, 84.425U-0138118\nCOVID-19, 84.425W-0459044\nCOVID-19, 84.425W-0459641\nCOVID-19, 84.425U-0137146\nKnown Questioned Cost Amount:\t$0\n\nBackground\nThe objectives of the Education Stabilization Fund (ESF) program are to prevent, prepare for and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal year 2022, the District expended a total of $22,519,443 of its ESF awards. This included $3,648,641 in the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER II) subprogram (84.425D), $18,850,563 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ARP ESSER/ESSER III) subprogram (84.425U), and $20,239 in the American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief \u2013 Homeless Children and Youth (ARP HCY I & II) subprogram (84.425W).\nFederal regulations require recipients to establish and maintain internal controls that ensure compliance with program requirements. These controls include understanding grant requirements and monitoring the effectiveness of established controls.\nUnder federal wage rate requirements, also known as the Davis-Bacon Act, contractors and subcontractors that work on projects financed with more than $2,000 of federal money must pay laborers and mechanics wage rates that the \nU.S. Department of Labor considers being similar to what local workers have been paid for similar projects.\nFor construction contracts subject to these wage rate requirements, the District must include a provision that the contractor and subcontractor comply with those requirements and the Department of Labor\u2019s regulations. This includes a requirement for the contractor and its subcontractor to submit to the District weekly, for each week in which any contract work is performed, certified payroll reports. These reports must include a copy of the payroll and a signed statement of compliance.\nThe District may use a contracted project manager to collect certified payroll reports from contractors and subcontractors, but ultimately, it is the District\u2019s responsibility to comply with these requirements and maintain documentation demonstrating compliance.\nDescription of Condition\nDuring the 2021-22 school year, the District spent $2,685,727 from its ESSER II award to pay two contractors and their subcontractors for installing and upgrading the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems at four school buildings and the District office. These projects were part of the District\u2019s school facility capital improvement efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and enable school operations by facilitating greater air flow and filtration. During the audit period, the District awarded and entered into a contract with one of the contractors, and contracted with two project managers to supervise the projects, which included collecting weekly certified payroll reports from the contractors and subcontractors.\nOur audit found the District did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements. Specifically, the District did not:\n\u2022\tInclude the required prevailing wage rate clauses in the contract established with one contractor\n\u2022\tCollect, or ensure project managers collected, weekly certified payroll reports from the contractors and their subcontractors to confirm they paid laborers proper prevailing wages\nWe consider these deficiencies in internal controls to be a material weakness, which led to material noncompliance.\nThe issue was not reported as a finding in the prior audit.\nCause of Condition\nDistrict staff said they used a purchasing cooperative to procure the general contractor, and they relied on the contract between the purchasing cooperative and the general contractor, which included the required prevailing wage language. However, staff said they did not know the District was required to include this language in its own contract with the contractor.\nAdditionally, the District relied on the project managers to verify the contractors and subcontractors submitted weekly certified payroll reports to the Washington State Labor and Industries (L&I) website. Although District staff said they checked that weekly certified payroll reports were uploaded to the L&I system before the District paid the contractors, this process was not documented. Further, District staff and project managers did not know the District needed to obtain all certified payroll reports each week.\nEffect of Condition \nWithout adequate internal controls that ensure it includes the prevailing wage rate clauses in its contracts and collects all weekly certified payroll reports, the District cannot demonstrate it complied with federal wage rate requirements. The District could also be liable for paying any additional wages if the contractors and subcontractors did not pay prevailing wage rates to laborers working on the contracts.\nRecommendation\nWe recommend the District develop internal controls to ensure compliance with federal wage rate requirements. This should include inserting prevailing wage rate clauses into contracts, as well as implementing effective monitoring processes to collect and review all weekly certified payroll reports timely from contractors and subcontractors.\nDistrict\u2019s Response\nThe District agrees with the State Auditor\u2019s Office that we did not have adequate internal controls for ensuring compliance with federal prevailing wage rate requirements as noted. The District used the same process as noted in this Finding in the prior audit which did not have any exceptions noted by the State Auditors Office. Moving forward the District will ensure federal prevailing wage rate clauses are in contracts entered into using federal funds and that weekly certified payroll reports are collected from contractors and subcontractors.\nAuditor\u2019s Remarks\nWe appreciate the District\u2019s commitment to resolve this finding and thank the District for its cooperation and assistance during the audit. We will review the status of the District\u2019s corrective action during our next audit.\nApplicable Laws and Regulations\nTitle 2 U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 200, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (Uniform Guidance), section 516, Audit findings, establishes reporting requirements for audit findings.\nTitle 2 CFR Part 200, Uniform Guidance, section 303, Internal controls, describes the requirements for auditees to maintain internal controls over federal programs and comply with federal program requirements.\nThe American Institute of Certified Public Accountants defines significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in its Codification of Statements on Auditing Standards, section 935, Compliance Audits, paragraph 11.\nTitle 29 CFR, Section 3.3 \u2013 Weekly statement with respect to payment of wages, and Section 3.4 \u2013 Submission of weekly statements and the preservation and inspection of weekly payroll records, establishes requirements for contractor or subcontractor submission of weekly certified payroll reports.\nTitle 29 CFR, Section 5.5 \u2013 Contract provisions and related matters establishes the requirements for the contracting officer to insert in full any contract in excess of $2,000 which is entered into for the actual construction, alteration and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of a public building or public work, or building or work financed in whole or in part with federal funds the clauses listed, which includes but is not limited to the minimum wages to be paid and payrolls and basic records to be maintained (submission of weekly certified payrolls)"
