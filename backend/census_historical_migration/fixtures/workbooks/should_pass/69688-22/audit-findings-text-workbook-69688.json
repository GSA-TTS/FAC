After the auditor tested selection #49, enough errors had been identified that the auditor stopped testing because the sample results could not support a low assessed level of control risk. The errors were a result of the misapplication of the sliding fee discount. The sliding fee discounts are based on the slide level code. In these instances, the sliding fee discount that was applied was not in accordance with the SFDS. \nEffect or Potential Effect: Either the Health Center or the patients may be paying more than required under the contract.\nCause: The Health Center applied its SFDS inconsistently to the patients selected for testing. \nRecommendation: The Health Center should adopt an internal control procedure that allows them to consistently apply its SFDS to all eligible patients. \nRepeat Finding: 2021-001\nViews of Responsible Officials: See page 12.",
