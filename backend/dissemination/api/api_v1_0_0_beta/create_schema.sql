-- Cloned from Lindsay's code in data_distro

-- We are self managing our migrations here
-- The SQL is called and applied from data_distro/migrations
-- This is a point in time of sql run that is comparable with data distro models. The views in the api_v1_0_0-beta_views folder represent the current views for the API_V1_0_0-BETA.
-- As the models change later, we don't want
-- our migration to reference fields that don't exist yet or already exist.

--This will be used by the postgrest API_V1_0_0-BETA
