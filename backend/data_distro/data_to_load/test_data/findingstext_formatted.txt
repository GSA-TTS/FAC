Significant Deficiency
Category of Finding - Other
Criteria - Pursuant to 2 CFR section 200.512(a), the reporting package shall be submitted within
the earlier of 30 days after receipt of the auditor’s report(s), or nine months after the end of
the audit period.
Condition - The Cooperative did not submit the Single Audit Reporting Package for the period
ended March 31, 2020 within nine months after the end of the audit period (December 31, 2020).
Cause - The Cooperative submitted a Single Audit Report prior to the required deadline, but it
was rejected due to the omission of the Corrective Action Plan, a component of the report
required by the OMB Uniform Guidance. The Corrective Action Plan was submitted in January
2021, and final approval of the Single Audit was received, but it was after the December 31,
2020 deadline.
Effect - Failure to submit the required Single Audit Reporting Package timely automatically results
in the Cooperative not qualifying for low-risk auditee status for the subsequent year’s single audit.
Recommendation - We recommend the Cooperative develop, document, and implement
policies and procedures for timely submission of the Single Audit Reporting Package.
Auditee’s comment - The Board of Directors will designate an individual to document financial
statement preparation processes to ensure timely submission of the Single Audit Reporting
Package.

"3"|"100000"|"2014"|"2021-001"|"Finding 2021-001
Criteria:
Generally, a system of internal control contemplates segregation of duties such that no individual has responsibility to execute a transaction, have physical access to the related assets, and have responsibility or authority to record the transactions.

Condition:
Due to the limited size of the Cooperative’s business staff, the Cooperative has limited segregation of duties.

Questioned Costs:
None.

Context:
The Cooperative has informed us that the small size of its business office staff precludes proper segregation of duties at this time.

Effect:
The Cooperative is unable to maintain segregation of incompatible duties.

Cause:
Limited number of staff in the business office.

Repeat Finding: 
The finding was reported in the prior year as finding 2020-001.

Recommendation:
We recommend that the Cooperative continue to segregate incompatible duties as best it can within the limits of what the Cooperative considers to be cost beneficial.

Current Status:
Unresolved, the Cooperative still has a limited number of staff in the business office. 

Action Taken:
The Cooperative reviews and makes improvements to its internal controls on an ongoing basis, and attempts to maximize the segregation of duties in all areas within the limits of the staff available.

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions:
The Cooperative agrees with this finding and will adhere to the corrective action plan.

"25156"|"100000"|"2021"|"2021-002"|"Finding 2021-002
Criteria:
Generally, a system of internal control includes the ability to understand and prepare the Cooperative’s financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).

Condition:
Due to the limited size of the Cooperative’s business staff and related resources available, the Cooperative has utilized the auditor to post adjusting journal entries and prepare the financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Questioned Costs:
None.

Context:
The Cooperative has informed us that the small size and qualifications of its business office staff precludes the Cooperative from posting adjusting journal entries and preparing its own financial statements.

Effect:
The Cooperative is unable to prepare GAAP based financial statements.

Cause:
Limited number of staff and hours available preclude the Cooperative from preparing the GAAP based financial statements. The Cooperative will continue to review auditor prepared financial statements.

Repeat Finding:
This finding was reported in the prior year as finding 2020-002.

Recommendation:
We recommend that the Cooperative continue to review the auditor prepared adjusting journal entries and financial statements with the intention of understanding and acceptance of responsibility for reporting under generally accepted accounting principles.

Current Status:
Unresolved, the number of staff and qualifications of staff have not changed. The Cooperative is continuing to review the auditor prepared adjusting journal entries and financial statements.

Action Taken:

Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions:
The Cooperative agrees with this finding and will adhere to the corrective action plan.
