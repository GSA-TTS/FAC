    Because this function was initially created in a view and not as a
    cross-validation function, it needs the crossval argument to distinguish between
    running in a cross-validation context and running in the context of needing to
    return progress information to the submission progress view.

    crossval defaults to True because we don't want to have to change all the calls to
    the validation functions to include this argument.

    Given the output of sac_validation_shape on a SingleAuditChecklist instance, and
    a SingleAuditReportFile instance, return information about submission progress.
