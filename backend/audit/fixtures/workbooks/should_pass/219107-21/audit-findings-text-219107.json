The error was corrected in the payment managementsystem in August 2021 and disclosed to us during the audit process.Effect  Federal funds were improperly held by RI for approximately seven months.Cause  After the original draw occurred, the payment was not posted against the invoicesand costs included in the request. As a result, the same invoices and costs were includedagain in the immediately following draw down which resulted in the overpayment.Recommendation  We recommend that management review the current processes andinternal controls for cash management and manke necessary changes to ensure federal drawsare processed accurately and reconciled timely.Views of Responsible Officials and Planned Corrective Actions  Managementagrees with the stated finding and has implemented a corrective action plan."
