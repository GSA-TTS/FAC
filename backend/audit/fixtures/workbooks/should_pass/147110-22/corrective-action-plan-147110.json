The Uniform Guidance part 200.214 identifies that non-Federal entities are subject to the non-procurement debarment and suspension regulations in 2 CFR part 180. 2 CFR part 180 requires that when you enter into a covered transaction with another person at the next lower tier, you must verify that the person with whom you intend to do business is not excluded or disqualified. You do this by: (a) Checking SAM Exclusions; or (b) Collecting a certification from that person; or (c) Adding a clause or condition to the covered transaction with that person. The Department meets this requirement as part of the contracting process by collecting certifications from the Community Agencies stating that they are not suspended or debarred. Therefore, we are in compliance with the Federal requirements for Suspension and debarment. The intent of the Departments policy to utilize the System for Award Management Exclusions (SAM) is to be an optional and additional assurance to the required collection of certifications that the next lower tier persons are not suspended or debarred. The SAM is utilized as time and resources permit and is not intended to replace the certifications.Completion Date:N/AAgency Contact:Jim Lopatosky, Director, Division of Contract Management, DHHS, 207-287-5075",

The systems we have in place are both necessary and sufficient in meeting programmatic requirements to ensure accurate eligibility determinations are being made. There has been no citation of federal regulation provided by OSA during this review that contradicts this.The Department would like to note: 1. Supervisors do a minimum of 1 case reading per month and a minimum of 1 call monitoring per week for staff on phones. It is commonplace for them to do more, especially for a new employee, or known coaching issues. 2. These case readings were tracked by supervisors and units and were tracked centrally on our Streamline Management Y-Drive in SFY2022. 3. Phone calls can be referenced by Supervisors in real time or afterwards, via recording. 4. Specifics of case reading, and call monitoring were formalized with specific expectations in multiple categories, which were followed up on by coaching staff if not all of the expectations were met. With a goal of continuous improvement, it was also noted to the OSA that we formally implemented the Calabrio System which dramatically enhanced and further automated our ability to track Case Readings and Call Monitoring performance statewide in June of 2022. A corresponding user guide was also developed and implemented in June of 2022. This example of continuous quality improvement has led to a more holistic understanding of trends and training needs.Furthermore, SNAP cases are randomly selected and reviewed by USDA partially-funded SNAP Quality Control staff. These findings are reported monthly to FNS and OFI senior management.A team of QC, training, program, operations, business technology and senior management meet bi-weekly to review trends and implement solutions.

The Department has subrecipient monitoring procedures for all of its subrecipients whether they were competitively bid or not.

Secondly, another risk assessment built into the Maine Uniform Accounting and Auditing Practices for Community Agencies (MAAP) in which requires higher risk subrecipients to undergo a higher level of testing. Additionally, there are audit and review requirements at a much lower threshold than that of the Uniform Guidance (UG). Finally, the Social Service Unit of the Division of Audit performs a risk assessment and tests transactions for those subrecipients that have been determined to be higher risk. The Department's subrecipient monitoring procedures ensures that we comply with the UG 200.332(d) Pass-through entity (PTE) monitoring of the subrecipient must include: 1) Review of financial and performance reports. 2) Following-up and ensuring that subrecipients take timely and appropriate action on all deficiencies. 3) Issues management decisions. 4) PTE is responsible for resolving audit findings specifically related to the subaward.

The Department reviews budgeted expenses to determine their timing and nature (one time, recurring, allowability); reviews quarterly expense reports and alters payments to meet immediate cash needs, and finally, monitors subrecipient single audits to ensure there are no cash management findings. The Department's approach is administratively reasonable and does minimize the time elapsing between the payment of Federal funds to the subrecipient and the subrecipients actual disbursement for program purposes given administrative and operational needs.

The OSC is responsible for determining the estimates in the financial statements. The accounting estimates are based on subjective, as well as, objective factors; therefore, professional judgement is required to estimate an amount for uncollectible receivables using an aging methodology, which is considered a common and acceptable method within the industry. Management's opinion is that this method is not overly sensitive to variations, is consistent with historical patterns and is not overly subjective or susceptible to bias. Applying this methodology, the OSC and the DOL accumulate relevant, sufficient, and reliable data on which to base the estimate. Additionally, we believe that the estimate is presented in conformity with the applicable accounting principles and that disclosure is adequate. The OSC recently performed a five-year trend analysis of historical collections with information provided by the DOL. The OSC compared the percentages and the assumptions used in the past and updated the reserve percentages accordingly. The OSC will continue to use the rolling year trend analysis with the actual collection data, as provided by the DOL, to update the reserve percentage. The DOL implemented a new system and the OSC will continue to review the reserve process to ensure the allowance continues to be valued properly.Completion Date:June 30, 2023Agency Contact:Stacey Thomas, Financial Management Coordinator, OSC, 207-626-8431",

As explained to OSA by DOE, DHHS, and USDA, Child Care Centers/Providers can enroll and claim over the licensed capacity. The claim edit check that was in place for SY22 for DCH Providers was Total Monthly Attendance x Approved Meal Types due to the fact that providers can enroll over the licensed capacity. Sponsors have been trained: Total Monthly Attendance equals the number of unique kids who attended during the day, are enrolled in CACFP and who ate at least one meal or snack during the day, then add up those daily totals for the month. To use licensed capacity as an edit check, which OSA did to calculate the costs in question, disallows provider reimbursement for eligible meals. CACFP Total Monthly Attendance is a better edit check as it only calculates attendance for enrolled participants. For the provider claims in question the CACFP Team tested them against the Total Monthly Attendance edit check and none suggest an overclaim. The CACFP Team discovered the missing enrollment edit check on 8/24/22 and immediately submitted a ticket to the web designers. This correction required multiple meetings with the web designers and in-depth system testing. The correction to the edit check was completed on 12/23/22.

Reasons include;  The ongoing quality assurance process is one of the major controls in place. In 2019, the OCFS Quality Assurance (QA) team, separate from the Child Care Subsidy Program (CCSP) team, comprised of 10 staff, began conducting 23 CCSP case reviews per month. This is systematic monitoring. QA uses the initial documentation submitted by the parent (applications, proof of income, etc.) and checks it against the information in the MACWIS system to ensure eligibility is calculated correctly and data was entered accurately. A summary of findings from the QA check is provided to CCSP management each month. CCSP management documents the needed remediation plan, with the Financial Resource Specialist (FRS) making the necessary corrections as soon as possible. Additionally, CCSP management conducts internal periodic audits of files and evaluates deficiencies.  Information Technology Controls minimizes potential errors by utilizing pre-defined drop-down menus of approved entries. Several fields limit the number of characters allowed to be entered or only allow numeric entries.  The Information Technology system provides an enhanced internal control that provides visual cues to enter dollar amounts. Users receive an error message if data is entered incorrectly. The Financial Resource Specialist Staff Manual provides detailed, step-by-step instructions of the process for entering information into the Information Technology system to ensure accuracy and consistency of data entry. Staff are trained using this manual and are provided ongoing access to the manual. Staff undergo regular training on the eligibility determination process.DHHS believes the process and technical solutions in place are a reasonable attempt to assure proper eligibility determination for CCSP funding.Completion Date:N/AAgency Contact:Todd Landry, Director of the Office of Child and Family Services, DHHS, 207-624-7900",
