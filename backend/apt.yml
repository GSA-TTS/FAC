# Because cf is using jammy jellyfish, and this https://packages.ubuntu.com/jammy/amd64/database/
# does not actually have postgresql-client-15 natively (only goes to 14),
# we are having to source the version from apt.postgresql.org. This however,
# eliminates the need to run v14 for load_data.sh, and can be run on v15.
# With v15, we are also able to run python manage.py dbbackup to backup the database
# to a defined s3 bucket. Running v15 also matches the client and server database versions.
